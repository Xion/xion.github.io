    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Python&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html">mocking library</a> is rather uncomplicated.
Most of what it does is creating <em>mock objects</em>: veritable sponges that absorb every interaction with any code
that we pass them&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>This simplicity is also surfaced in the <span class="caps">API</span>, especially in the main part of it &#8212; the <code>mock.Mock</code> constructor:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;http://example.com&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">some_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;http://example.com&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Any arguments that we pass there become attributes on the resulting mock object. This is really useful when
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#the-patchers">patching</a>, because it allows us to completely specify
the replacement object within a <code>@mock.patch</code> decorator:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@patch.object</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">requests</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;get&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">new</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">return_value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">status_code</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">400</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_404</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertRaises</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NotFoundError</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">do_stuff</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You have to keep in mind, however, that the <code>mock.Mock</code> class also has some
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock">constructor arguments</a> of its own.
For this reason, there exists some potential for name collision: some of the <code>Mock</code><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>s own arguments may have the same
names as the <em>attributes</em> we&#8217;d like to set on the mock&nbsp;object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c"># doesn&#39;t set the `name` attribute</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">some_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span>  <span class="c"># blows up!</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, the <code>name</code> argument is inherent to the <code>Mock</code> class. Its constructor will interpret it in a special way,
and so it <em>won&#8217;t</em> set a <code>name</code> attribute on the resulting mock. Other possible culprits include the <code>spec</code> and <code>wraps</code>
parameters, both of which have relatively common names that we may want to use as object attributes<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Collision&nbsp;avoidance</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s trivial to fix the issue, of&nbsp;course:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">some_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">sock_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>but this approach has a downside. Creating and configuring a mock is no longer a single expression, which means we cannot
use it with patchers as easily as&nbsp;before:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@patch.object</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mock_bar</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">mock_bar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span>
    <span class="c"># (...rest of the test...)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We can either configure the mock after patching, like above, or perhaps introduce some utility functions to be called
inside the <code>@patch</code> decorator.</p>
<h4>The almost-there&nbsp;method</h4>
<p>In any case, this is somewhat disappointing. And it is even more so when we discover that there is
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.configure_mock">a method called <code>configure_mock</code></a>
which <em>looks</em> like it was designed to solve this very issue. Its arguments are always interpreted as attributes
of the mock: it has no &#8220;special&#8221; or &#8220;reserved&#8221; names. Indeed, this method is what allows us to actually
write the mock setup as a single&nbsp;expression:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure_mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Problem is, this expression returns <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>Yes, <code>configure_mock</code> returns nothing.<br>
Or in other words, it doesn&#8217;t return anything.<br>
In fact, it has <a href="https://github.com/testing-cabal/mock/blob/286792b2cd5b5baa8338260538ed207391280e34/mock/mock.py#L671">no <code>return</code> statement</a>&nbsp;whatsoever.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it doesn&#8217;t have the <code>return self</code> line that&#8217;d enable us to write&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure_mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Well, that is <em>quite</em> a&nbsp;let-down.</p>
<h4>Fixing&nbsp;it</h4>
<p>But hey, this is Python! Shortcomings like that don&#8217;t necessarily mean we have to fork whole libraries.
Let&#8217;s just add the missing <code>return</code>, shall&nbsp;we?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">mock</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Mock</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">_Mock</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_Mock</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">configure_mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure_mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span>  <span class="c"># &lt;-- there!</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Whew, that was&nbsp;quick!</p>
<p>&#8230;Alright, that&#8217;s actually the <em>whole</em> fix, but it&#8217;s close. To complete it, we need to apply the same treatment to
three more <code>Mock</code> classes: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.MagicMock"><code>MagicMock</code></a>,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.NonCallableMock"><code>NonCallableMock</code></a>,
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.NonCallableMagicMock"><code>NonCallableMagicMock</code></a>.</p>
<p>A complete solution can be seen in <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/8b98733d4b6be354be0ebae815ebd22d">this gist</a>.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Collision may also occur with <code>mock.patch</code> constructs. The most likely offender there is probably
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch"><code>new</code> parameter</a>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p><em>&#8230;or: The Most Hideous Hack I&#8217;ve (Almost)&nbsp;Done</em></p>
<p>In <a href="http://github.com/Xion/callee">callee</a>, the <a href="http://callee.readthedocs.org">argument matcher library for Python</a> that
<a href="http://xion.io/post/news/callee-intro.html">I released recently</a>, there is this lovely
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/callee/blob/f695ff4e1c45bfd45445ebb8014a202029a93dce/callee/general.py#L55"><code>TODO</code> note</a>
for a seemingly simple feature. When using the
<a href="http://callee.readthedocs.org/en/stable/reference/general.html#callee.general.Matching"><code>Matching</code> construct</a>
with a simple <code>lambda</code> predicate:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mock_foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Matching</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>it would be great to see its <em>code</em> in the error message if the assertion fails. Right now it&#8217;s just going to say
something like <code>&lt;Matching &lt;function &lt;lambda&gt; at 0x7f5d8a06eb18&gt;&gt;</code>. Provided you don&#8217;t possess a supernatural ability
of dereferencing pointers in your head, this won&#8217;t give you any immediate hint as to what went wrong. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice
if it read as, say, <code>&lt;Matching \x: x % 2&gt;</code> instead?<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So I thought: why not try and implement such a mechanism? This is Python, after all &#8212; a language where you can spawn
<a href="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2015/02/09/understanding-python-metaclasses/#simple-metaclass-use">completely new classes</a>
at runtime, walk the stack <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html#the-interpreter-stack">backwards</a>
(or even <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.settrace">forward</a>) and read the local variables,
or change the behavior of the <a href="http://xion.org.pl/2012/05/06/hacking-python-imports/">import system itself</a>.
Surely it would be possible &#8212; nay, easy &#8212; to get the source code of a short lambda function,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Boy, was I <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, though: the task turned out to be absolutely doable, at least in the scope I wanted it done.
But what would you think of a solution that involves not just the usual Python hackery, but also <span class="caps">AST</span> inspection,
transformations of the source code as text, <em>and</em> bytecode&nbsp;shenanigans?&#8230;</p>
<h4>The code, all the code, and&#8230; much more than the&nbsp;code</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning, though. Here&#8217;s a short lambda function, the kind of which we&#8217;d like to obtain
the source code&nbsp;of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">is_even</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If the documentation for Python standard library is to be believed, this should be pretty easy.
In the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html"><code>inspect</code> module</a>,
there is a function called no different than
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html#inspect.getsource"><code>getsource</code></a>. For our purposes, however,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html#inspect.getsourcelines"><code>getsourcelines</code></a> is a little more
convienient, because we can easily tell when the lambda is too&nbsp;long:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_short_lambda_source</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lambda_func</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">source_lines</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">inspect</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getsourcelines</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lambda_func</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">IOError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_lines</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">source_lines</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Of course if you programmed in Python for any longer period of time, you know very well that the standard docs
are <em>not</em> to be trusted. And it&#8217;s not just that the <code>except</code> clause should also include <code>TypeError</code>, because it
will be thrown when you try to pass any of the Python builtins to <code>getsourcelines</code>.</p>
<p>More important is the ambiguity of what does &#8220;source lines for an object&#8221; actually mean. &#8220;Source lines <em>containing</em>
the object definition&#8221; would be much more accurate, and this seemingly small distinction is rather crucial here.
Passing a lambda function to either <code>getsourcelines</code> or <code>getsource</code>, we&#8217;ll get its source <em>and everything else</em>
that the returned lines&nbsp;included.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Say hello to the complete <code>is_even =</code> assignment, and the entire <code>assert_called_with</code> invocation!
And in case you are wondering: yes, the result will also include any end-of-line comments. No token left&nbsp;behind!</p>
<h4>Trim&nbsp;left</h4>
<p>Clearly this is more than we&#8217;ve bargained for. Maybe there is a way to strip away the unnecessary cruft? Python does
know how to parse itself, after all: the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html"><code>ast</code> module</a>
is a manifestation of this knowledge. Perhaps we can use it to retrieve the <code>lambda</code> <span class="caps">AST</span> node in order to turn it &#8212;
and just it &#8212; back into Python&nbsp;code?&#8230;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_short_lambda_ast_node</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lambda_func</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">source_text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_short_lambda_source</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lambda_func</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">source_text</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">source_ast</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ast</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_text</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">next</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">node</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">ast</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">walk</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_ast</span><span class="p">)</span>
                     <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">node</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ast</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Lambda</span><span class="p">)),</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But as it turns out, getting the source text back this way is only <em>mostly</em>&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>See, every substantial <span class="caps">AST</span> node &#8212; which is either an expression (<code>ast.expr</code>) or a statement (<code>ast.stmt</code>) &#8212;
has two common attributes: <code>lineno</code> and <code>col_offset</code>. When combined, they point to a place in the original source code
where the node was parsed from. This is how we can find out where to look for the definition of our lambda&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>Looks promising, right? The only problem is we don&#8217;t know when to <em>stop</em> looking.
That&#8217;s right: nodes created by <code>ast.parse</code> are annotated with their start offset, but not with length nor the end offset.
As a result, the best we can do when it comes to carving out the lambda source from the very first example is&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So close! Those hanging parentheses are evidently just taunting us, but how can we remove them? <code>lambda</code> is basically
just a Python expression, so in principle it can be followed by almost anything. This is doubly true for lambdas inside
the <code>Matching</code> construct, as they may be a part of some larger mock&nbsp;assertion:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mock_foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Matching</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">Integer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">GreaterThan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, the extraneous suffix is the entirety of <code>), Integer() &amp; GreaterThan(42))</code>, quite a lot of more than just <code>))</code>.
And that&#8217;s of course nowhere near the limit of possiblities: for one, there may be more <code>lambda</code>s in there,&nbsp;too!</p>
<h4>Back off, <em>slowly</em></h4>
<p>It seems, however, that there is one thing those troublesome tails have in common: <em>they aren&#8217;t syntactically valid</em>.</p>
<p>Intuitively, a <code>lambda</code> node nested within some other syntactical constructs will have their closing fragments (e.g. <code>)</code>)
appear somewhere after its end. Without the corresponding openings (e.g. <code>Matching(</code>), those fragments won&#8217;t&nbsp;parse.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the crazy idea. What we have is invalid Python, but only because of some unspecified number of extra characters.
How about we just try and remove them, one by one, until we get something that <em>is</em> syntactically correct?
If we are not mistaken, this will finally be our lambda and nothing&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>The fortune favors the brave, so let&#8217;s go ahead and try&nbsp;it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># ... continuing get_short_lambda_source() ...</span>

<span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Considering that we&#8217;re basically taking lessons from the dusty old tomes in the Restricted Section of Hogwarts library,
the magic here looks quite simple. As long as there is something that can pass for a lambda definition,
we try to parse it and see if it succeeds. The line that says <code>except SyntaxError:</code> is obviously not something for
the faint of heart, but at least we are specifying
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/doanddont.html#except"><em>what</em> exception</a> we anticipate&nbsp;catching.</p>
<p>And the kicker? It <em>works</em>. By that I mean it doesn&#8217;t return garbage results for a few obvious and not so obvious
test cases, which is already more than you would normally expect from hacks of this magnitude.
All the lambdas defined until this paragraph, for example, can have their source code extracted without&nbsp;issue.</p>
<h4>Just one more&nbsp;thing</h4>
<p>So&#8230; victory? Not quite. Astute readers may recall my promise of some bytecode arcana, and now&#8217;s the time for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Despite the initial success of our gradual, character dropping approach, there are cases where it doesn&#8217;t produce
the correct result. Consider, for example, a lambda definition that&#8217;s nestled within a tuple<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">get_short_lambda_source</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We would of course expect the result to be <code>lambda _: True</code>, without a comma or&nbsp;zero.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, here&#8217;s where our earlier assumption fails rather spectacularly. The line of code extracted from <span class="caps">AST</span>
is syntactically valid even <em>with</em> the extra characters. As a result, <code>ast.parse</code> succeeds too early and returns an
incorrect definition. It should have been of a lambda contained within a tuple, but tuple is apparently what the lambda
<em>returns</em>.</p>
<p>You may say that this is the sharp end of a narrow edge case, and anyone who defines functions like that deserves all
the trouble they get. And sure, I wouldn&#8217;t mind if we just threw hands in the air and told them we&#8217;re simply unable
to retrieve the source here. But my opinion is that it doesn&#8217;t justify serving them obviously <em>wrong</em>&nbsp;results!</p>
<h4>A halting&nbsp;problem</h4>
<p>Not if we can help it, anyway. Have a look at the expected source code and the one we&#8217;ve extracted, side by&nbsp;side:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The second line isn&#8217;t just longer: it is also <em>doing more</em>. It isn&#8217;t just defining a lambda; it defines it,
conjures up a constant <code>0</code>, and then packs them both into a tuple. That&#8217;s at least two additional steps compared to
the&nbsp;original.</p>
<p>Those steps have a more precise name, too: they are the <em>bytecode instructions</em>. Every piece of Python source is compiled
to a binary bytecode before it&#8217;s executed, because the interpreter can only work with this representation.
Compilation typically happens when a Python module is first imported, producing a <em>.pyc</em> file corresponding to its
<em>.py</em> file. Subsequent imports will simply reuse the cached&nbsp;bytecode.</p>
<p>Moreover, any function or class object has its bytecode accessible (read-only) at runtime. There is even a
<a href="http://late.am/post/2012/03/26/exploring-python-code-objects.html">dedicated data type</a> to hold it &#8212; called simply
<code>code</code> &#8212; with a buffer of raw bytes under one of its&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>Finally, the bytecode compiler itself is also available to Python programs as a built-in
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#compile"><code>compile</code> function</a>. You don&#8217;t see it used as often as its
counterparts <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval"><code>eval</code></a>
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#exec"><code>exec</code></a> (which hopefully are a rare sight themselves!),
but it taps into the same internal machinery of&nbsp;Python.</p>
<p>So how does it all add up? The idea is, basically, to cross-check the alleged source code of the lambda with its own
<em>byte</em>code. Any junk that&#8217;s still left to trim &#8212; even if syntactically valid &#8212; will surface as a divergence after
compilation. Thus we can simply continue dropping characters until the bytecodes&nbsp;match:</p>

</pre></div>


<p>Okay, maybe not the exact bytes<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, but stopping at the identical bytecode <em>length</em> is good enough a strategy.
As an obvious bonus, <code>compile</code> will also take care of detecting syntax errors in the candidate source code,
so we don&#8217;t need the <code>ast</code> parsing&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<h4>That escalated&nbsp;quickly!</h4>
<p>Believe it or not, but there aren&#8217;t any more objections to this solution, You can view it in its glorious entirety
by looking at <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/617c1496ff45f3673a5692c3b0e3f75a">this gist</a>.</p>
<p>Does it mean it is also making its cameo in the <a href="https://github.com/Xion/callee"><em>callee</em> library</a>?&#8230;</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m afraid&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Normally, I&#8217;m not the one to shy away from, ahem, <em>bold</em> solutions to tough problems. But in this case, the magnitude
of hackery required is just too great, the result not satisfactory enough, the feature&#8217;s priority isn&#8217;t really
all that high, and the maintenance burden it&#8217;d introduce is most likely too&nbsp;large.</p>
<p>In the end, it was great fun figuring it out: yet another example of how you can fiddle with Python to do basically
anything. Still, we must not get too preoccupied with whether or not we can as to forget if we <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>Why we won&#8217;t always get an identical bytecode? The short answer is that some instructions may be swapped
for their approximate equivalents.<br/>
The long answer is that with <code>compile</code>, we aren&#8217;t able to replicate the exact closure environment of the original lambda.
When a function refers to an <em>free variable</em> (like <code>foo</code> in <code>lambda x: x + foo</code>), it is its closure where the value
for that variable comes from. For ad-hoc lambdas, this is typically the local scope of its <em>outer function</em>.</br>
Code produced by <code>compile</code>, however, isn&#8217;t associated with any such local scope. All free names are thus assumed
to refer to <em>global</em> variables. Because Python uses different bytecode instructions for referencing local and global
names (<code>LOAD_FAST</code> vs <code>LOAD_GLOBAL</code>), the result of <code>compile</code> may differ from a piece of bytecode produced in the regular
manner.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Here&#8217;s a trick that&#8217;s hardly new, but if you haven&#8217;t heard about, it will save you a trip to a man page or&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;re a person who mostly prefers the terminal over some fancy <span class="caps">GUI</span>, you&#8217;ve probably used the <code>find</code> command
along with <code>xargs</code> at least a few times. It&#8217;s very common, for example, to use the results of <code>find</code> as arguments
to some other program. It could something as simple as figuring out which modules in your project have grown
slightly too&nbsp;large:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ find . -name &#39;*.py&#39; | xargs wc -l | sort -hr
1467 total
 322 callee/base.py
 261 callee/general.py
 251 callee/collections.py
# etc.
</pre></div>


<p>We find them all first, and then use <code>xargs</code> to build a long <code>wc</code> invocation, and we finally display results
in the reverse order. Pretty easy stuff: I don&#8217;t usually have to try more than a dozen times to get it right!<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But how about the opposite situation? Let&#8217;s say you have a list of <em>directories</em> you want to search through with <code>find</code>.
Doing so may seem easy enough<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs find -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>Except it&#8217;s not going to work. Like a few other Unix commands, <code>find</code> is very particular about the order of arguments
it receives. Not only are the predicate flags (like <code>-name</code>) considered in sequence, but they also have to appear
<em>after</em> the directories we want to search&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>But in the <code>xargs</code> invocation above, essentially the opposite is going to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<h4>The replacement&nbsp;flag</h4>
<p>So how to remedy this? Enter the <code>-I</code> flag to <code>xargs</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>This flag will tell <code>xargs</code> quite a few&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>The most important one is to stop putting the arguments at the end of the command invocation.
Instead, it shall place them wherever it sees the <em>replacement string</em> &#8212; here, pair of braces<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: <code>{}</code>.
And because we placed the braces where <code>find</code> is normally expecting the list of directories to search through,
the command will now get us exactly the results we&nbsp;wanted.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s almost impossible to see, however, is that it may not use the exact <em>way</em> we intended to obtain those results.
The difference is easier to spot when we replace <code>find</code> with <code>echo</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat &gt;/tmp/list
foo
bar
$ cat /tmp/list | xargs echo
foo bar
$ cat /tmp/list | xargs -I{} echo {}
foo
bar
</pre></div>


<p>or, better yet, use <code>xargs</code> with the <code>-t</code> flag to print the commands on stderr before executing&nbsp;them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} -t find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39; &gt;/dev/null
find callee -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
find tests -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, we actually have more than one <code>find</code> invocation&nbsp;here!</p>
<p>This is the second effect of <code>-I</code>: it causes <code>xargs</code> to execute given command line <em>for each argument separately</em>.
It so happens that it doesn&#8217;t really make any difference for our usage of <code>find</code>, which is why it wasn&#8217;t at all obvious
we were running it multiple&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>To avoid problems, though, you should definitely be cognizant of this fact when calling other programs with <code>xargs -I</code>.</p>
<h4>Make arguments spaced&nbsp;again</h4>
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;m not aware of any method that&#8217;d actually make <code>xargs</code> produce <code>find foo bar -name ...</code> calls.
If you need this exact form, probably the easiest way is to use plain old shell&nbsp;variables:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find $d -name &#39;*.py&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>This takes advantage of the <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting">word splitting</a> feature of Bash and a few other
compatible shells. Caveat is, you may be using a shell where this behavior is disabled by default. The result would be
making <code>find</code> interpret the content of <code>$d</code> as a <em>single</em> directory name: <code>foo bar</code> rather than <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>.</p>
<p>zsh is one such shell. Although <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq03.html#l18">probably a good thing overall</a>,
in times like these you&#8217;d want to bring the &#8220;normal&#8221; behavior back. In zsh, it&#8217;s fortunately pretty&nbsp;simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find ${=d} -name &#39;*.py&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>What about a portable solution? As far as I can tell, the only certain way you can ensure word splitting occurs
is to use <code>eval</code>. Here, the <code>xargs</code> command can actually come in handy again, albeit only as a&nbsp;prop:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt | xargs echo); eval &quot;find $d -name &#39;*.py&#39;&quot;)
</pre></div>


<p>One would hope such hacks aren&#8217;t needed very&nbsp;often.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>A completely kosher version would also use the <code>-print0</code> flag to <code>find</code> and the <code>-0</code> flag to <code>xargs</code>.
It&#8217;s not necessary here because Python module files cannot contain spaces.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2">

</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>This use of braces in <code>find</code> has of course nothing to do with the <em>other</em> possible occurrences of <code>{}</code> there,
like in the <code>-exec</code> flag. Since you cannot force <code>find</code> to expect a different placeholder, you should use something else
for <code>xargs</code> in those cases, .e.g: <code>xargs -I^ find ^ -name '__main__.py' -exec 'python {}' \;</code>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p><em>&#8230;or how I learned to stop worrying and love the borrow&nbsp;checker.</em></p>
<p>Having no equivalents in other languages, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html">borrow checker</a>
is arguably the most difficult thing to come to terms with when learning Rust. It&#8217;s easy to understand why it&#8217;s immensely
useful, especially if you recall
<a href="https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2016/02/cve-2015-7547-glibc-getaddrinfo-stack.html">the various vulnerabities</a>
stemming from memory mismanagement. But that knowledge doesn&#8217;t exactly help when the compiler is whining about what
seems like a perfectly correct&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: it will take some time to become productive writing efficient and safe code. It&#8217;s not entirely unlike
adjusting to a different paradigm such as functional programming when you&#8217;ve been writing mostly imperative code.
Before that happens, though, you can use some tricks to make the transition a little&nbsp;easier.</p>
<h4>Just <code>clone</code> it</h4>
<p>Ideally, we&#8217;d want our code to be both correct <em>and</em> fast. But if we cannot quite get to the &#8220;correctness&#8221; part yet &#8212;
because our program doesn&#8217;t, you know, <em>compile</em> &#8212; then how about paying for it with a small (and refundable)
performance&nbsp;hit?</p>
<p>This is where the <code>clone</code> method comes in handy. Many problems with the borrow checker stem from trying to spread
object ownership too thin. It is a precious resource and it&#8217;s not very cheap to &#8220;produce&#8221;, which is why good Rust code
often deals with just immutable or mutable&nbsp;references.</p>
<p>But if that proves difficult, then &#8220;making more objects&#8221; is a great intermediate solution. Incidentally, this is what
higher level languages are doing all the time, and often transparently. To ease the transition to Rust from
those languages, we can start off by replicating their&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a function that tries to convert some value to <code>String</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">maybe_to_string</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// omitted</span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>If we attempt to build upon it and create a <code>Vec</code>tor&nbsp;version:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">maybe_all_to_string</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Err</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">Ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>then we&#8217;ll be unpleasantly surprised by a borrow checker&nbsp;error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>error: cannot move out of borrowed content [E0507]
    Ok(results.iter().map(|r| r.ok().unwrap()).collect())
                              ^
</pre></div>


<p>Much head scratching will ensue, and we may eventually find an idiomatic and efficient solution.
However, a simple stepping stone in the shape of additional <code>clone()</code> call can help move things forward just
a little&nbsp;quicker:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#[derive(Clone)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="nb">Ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">clone</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>The performance tradeoff is explicit, and easy to find later on with a simple <code>grep clone\(\)</code> or similar.
When you learn to do things the Rusty way, it won&#8217;t be hard to go back to your &#8220;hack&#8221; and fix it&nbsp;properly.</p>
<h4>Refcounting to the&nbsp;rescue</h4>
<p>Adding <code>clone()</code> willy-nilly to make the code compile is a valid workaround when we&#8217;re just learning. Sometimes, however,
even some gratuitous cloning doesn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> solve the problem, because the <code>clone()</code> itself can become an&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>For one, it requires our objects to implement the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html"><code>Clone</code> trait</a>.
This was apparent even in our previous example, since we had to add a <code>#[derive(Clone)]</code> attribute to the <code>struct Error</code>
in order to make it <code>clone</code>-able.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the vast majority of cases this will be all that&#8217;s necessary, as most built-in types in Rust implement
<code>Clone</code> already. One notable exception are <em>function traits</em> (<code>FnOnce</code>, <code>Fn</code>, and <code>FnMut</code>) which are used to store
and refer to <em>closures</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Structures and other custom types that contain them (or those which <em>may</em> contain them)
cannot therefore implement <code>Clone</code> through a simple <code>#[derive]</code> annotation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c-Doc">/// A value that&#39;s either there already</span>
<span class="c-Doc">/// or can be obtained by calling a function.</span>
<span class="cp">#[derive(Clone)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">enum</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">LazyValue</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Clone</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Immediate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Deferred</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Fn</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre>error: the trait `core::marker::Sized` is not implemented for the type `core::ops::Fn() -&gt; T + &#39;static` [E0277]
    #[derive(Clone)]
             ^~~~~
</pre></div>


<p>What can we do in this case, then? Well, there is yet another kind of performance concessions we can make,
and this one will likely sound familiar if you&#8217;ve ever worked with a higher level language before. Instead of actually
cloning an object, you can merely increment its <em>reference counter</em>. As the most rudimentary kind of garbage collection,
this allows to safely share the object between multiple &#8220;owners&#8221;, where each can behave as if it had
its own copy of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Rust&#8217;s pointer type that provides reference counting capabilities is called <code>std::rc::Rc</code>. Conceptually, it is analogous
to <code>std::shared_ptr</code> from C++, and it similarly keeps the refcount updated when the pointer is &#8220;acquired&#8221; (<code>clone</code>-ed)
and &#8220;released&#8221; (<code>drop</code>-ed). Because no data is moved around during either of those two operations, <code>Rc</code> can refer even
to types whose size isn&#8217;t known at compilation time, like abstract&nbsp;closures:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">rc</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Rc</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="cp">#[derive(Clone)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">enum</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">LazyValue</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Clone</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Immediate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Deferred</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Rc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Fn</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Wrapping them in <code>Rc</code> therefore makes them &#8220;cloneable&#8221;. They aren&#8217;t actually cloned, of course, but because of
the inherent immutability of Rust types they will appear so to any outside observer<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Move&nbsp;it!</h4>
<p>Ultimately, most problems with the borrow checker boil down to unskillful mixing of the two ways you handle data in Rust.
There is <em>ownership</em>, which is passed around by moving the values; and there is <em>borrowing</em>, which means operating
on them through&nbsp;references.</p>
<p>When you try to switch from one to the other, some friction is bound to occur. Code that uses references, for example,
has to be copiously sprinkled with <code>&amp;</code> and <code>&amp;mut</code>, and may sometimes require explicit lifetime annotations. All these
have to be added or removed, and changes like that tend to propagate quite readily to the upper layers
of the program&#8217;s&nbsp;logic.</p>
<p>Therefore it is generally preferable, if at all possible, to deal with data directly
and not through references. To maintain efficiency, however, we need to learn how to move the objects through the various
stages of our algorithms. It turns out it&#8217;s surprisingly easy to inadvertently borrow something, hindering the possibility
of producing a moved&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>Take our first example. The intuitively named <code>Vec::iter</code> method produces an iterator that we can <code>map</code> over, but does
it really go over the actual <em>items</em> in the vector? Nope! It gives us a <em>reference</em> to each one &#8212; a borrow, if you will
&#8212; which is exactly why we originally had to use <code>clone</code> to get out of this&nbsp;bind.</p>
<p>Instead, why not just get the elements themselves, by moving them out of the vector? <code>Vec::into_iter</code> allows to do exactly&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">Ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">into_iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>and enables us to remove the <code>clone()</code> call. The family of similar <code>into_X</code> (or even just <code>into</code>) methods can be reliably counted
on at least in the standard library. They are also part of a more-or-less official
<a href="https://aturon.github.io/style/naming.html#conversions">naming convention</a> that you should also follow in your own&nbsp;code.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Note how this is different from function <em>types</em>, i.e. <code>fn(A, B, C, ...) -&gt; Ret</code>. It is because plain functions
do not carry their closure environments along with them. This makes them little more than just pointers to some code,
and those can be freely <code>Clone</code>-d (or even <code>Copy</code>-ed).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div>
      <p>In this post I&#8217;ll describe all (hopefully all!) the various ways you can specify a single dependency for a Python&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>This assumes <em>pip</em> is used for installation. The list of dependencies then goes either in <code>install_requires=</code>
parameter of the <code>setup</code> function within <em>setup.py</em>, or as a separate <em>requirements.txt</em> file. Commonly, it will actually
go in both places, with the latter being the canonical source of&nbsp;truth:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">setuptools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">setup</span>

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;requirements.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">rf</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="c"># ...</span>
        <span class="n">install_requires</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">rf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readlines</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>More details about this approach can be found in
<a href="http://xion.org.pl/2014/01/27/anathomy-of-a-python-package/">one of my previous posts</a>.</p>
<p>Here, I will concentrate on the format of a single line in <em>requirements.txt</em> that defines a dependency.
There are numerous variants that <em>pip</em> supports, and they are all described in excruciating detail in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/"><span class="caps">PEP</span> 440</a>. This post shall serve as a short reference on the most useful&nbsp;ones.</p>
<h4>Package name (and&nbsp;version)</h4>
<p>The simplest and most common option is to identify a dependency by its package&nbsp;name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy
</pre></div>


<p>This will locate it in a global index of packages, which is sometimes called a &#8220;cheese shop&#8221;. Currently,
by far the most popular package registry for Python is <a href="https://pypi.python.org">PyPI</a>, and <em>pip</em> uses it by default<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Without any further modifiers, <em>pip</em> will download and install the &#8220;current&#8221; version of the package &#8212; either the newest,
or the one designated explicitly by a maintainer. This obviously makes the dependency somewhat unpredictable,
for it can mean unintended upgrades that introduce breaking changes to your&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>To prevent this, you&#8217;d normally <em>pin</em> the dependency to an exact version<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy==0.9.10
</pre></div>


<p>Other comparison operators are also&nbsp;available:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy&gt;=0.9.10
SQLAlchemy&lt;1.0.0
</pre></div>


<p>and can even be&nbsp;combined:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy&gt;=0.9,&lt;1.0.0
</pre></div>


<p>Specs like that will make <em>pip</em> find the newest version that&#8217;s within given range. Assuming your dependency follows
the <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> scheme, this will allow you to stay on top of any minor bugfixes
and improvements to an older release (0.9.x here), without the risk of accidentally upgrading to a new one (1.x)
that your code is not compatible with&nbsp;yet.</p>
<h4>Repository <span class="caps">URL</span></h4>
<p>Sometimes you want to live on the bleeding edge, though, and depend not just on the latest <em>release</em>,
but the head <em>commit</em> to the package&#8217;s repository. This makes sense especially in large systems
that are distributed among multiple repos, and where development happens in&nbsp;lockstep.</p>
<p>For those occasions, and a few others, <em>pip</em> can recognize direct repository URLs. They are in the&nbsp;format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$VCS+$PROTOCOL://$URL@$LABEL#egg=$PACKAGE
</pre></div>


<p>where the <code>$PROTOCOL</code> part can be optional if the version control system has a default there. That&#8217;s for example
the case for <code>git</code>, which is of course the most important <span class="caps">VCS</span> you&#8217;d be interested in<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git://git.example.com/somepackage#egg=somepackage
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the <code>#egg=$PACKAGE</code> part is not a part of the <code>$URL</code>, and it&#8217;s only there to give a local name for the package
distribution. This is what makes it possible to refer to it later via <em>pip</em>, if only to remove it with
<code>pip uninstall $PACKAGE</code>.
Of course, the sanest practice is to use the PyPI moniker if&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>When no <code>$LABEL</code> is given, <em>pip</em> will use the <span class="caps">HEAD</span>, trunk, tip, or the equivalent default/current revision from the repo.
Often though (at least in case of Git), you would also pick a branch, tag, or even a particular <em>commit hash</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git+https://github.com/Xion/unmatcher.git@0.1.3.1#egg=unmatcher
git+ssh://github.com/You/yourpackage.git@master#egg=yourpackage
git+https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2.git@5b498453b5898257b2287f14ef6c363799f1405a#egg=Jinja2
</pre></div>


<p>The last two options could be a good choice even with third party packages, when you don&#8217;t want to wait for a new PyPI
release to get a necessary feature or an urgent bug&nbsp;fix.</p>
<h4>Local&nbsp;filesystem</h4>
<p>Lastly, you can ask <em>pip</em> to install a package from a local directory or archive. The former option is often used
with the <code>-e</code> (<code>--editable</code>) flag for <code>pip install</code>. This installs the package in the so-called <em>development mode</em>,
allowing you to edit its source code&nbsp;in-place:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ pip install -e /home/me/Code/myotherpackage
</pre></div>


<p>You almost certainly don&#8217;t want to put this line in <em>requirements.txt</em>: you should still be pulling the other package
from PyPI. But if it&#8217;s your own one  &#8212; maybe a self-contained utility library used by your main program &#8212;
this setup will be very helpful for making changes to it, informed by your own usage of the&nbsp;package.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>This can be changed with <code>--index_url</code> flag to <code>pip install</code>. Running local indexes is a good practice
for Python shops, especially those that rely on <code>pip install</code> as part of their deployment process.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>To prevent the kind of memory errors that plagues many C programs,
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html"><em>borrow checker</em> in Rust</a> tracks how data is moved between variables,
or accessed via references. This is all done at compile time, with zero runtime overhead, and is a sizeable part
of Rust&#8217;s value&nbsp;offering.</p>
<p>Like all rigid and automated systems, however, it is necessarily constrained and cannot handle all situations perfectly.
One of its limitations is treating all objects as <em>atomic</em>. It&#8217;s impossible for a variable to own a part of some bigger
structure, neither is it possible to maintain mutable references to two or more elements of a&nbsp;collection.</p>
<p>If we nonetheless <a href="http://is.gd/yWCYmJ">try</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">get_name</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">names</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">vec</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Smith&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">()];</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>we&#8217;ll be served with a classic borrow checker&nbsp;error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&lt;anon&gt;:3:25: 3:33 error: cannot move out of indexed content [E0507]
&lt;anon&gt;:3     let fullname = join(names[0], names[1]);
                                 ^~~~~~~~
</pre></div>


<p>Behind its rather cryptic verbiage, it informs us that we tried to move a <em>part</em> of the <code>names</code> vector &#8212; its first
element &#8212; to a new variable (here, a function parameter). This isn&#8217;t allowed, because in principle it would
render the vector invalid from the standpoint of strict memory safety. Rust would no longer guarantee <code>names[0]</code> to be
a legal <code>String</code>: its internal pointer could&#8217;ve been invalidated by the code which the element moved to
(the <code>join</code> function)<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But while commendable, this guarantee isn&#8217;t exactly <em>useful</em> here. Even though <code>names[0]</code> would technically be invalid,
there isn&#8217;t anyone to actually notice this fact. The <code>names</code> vector is inaccessible outside of the function
it&#8217;s defined in, and even the function itself doesn&#8217;t look at it after the move. In its present form,
the program <del>is inarguably correct</del><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> could&#8217;ve been accepted if partial moves from <code>Vec</code> were allowed
by the borrow&nbsp;checker.</p>
<h4>Pointers to the&nbsp;rescue?</h4>
<p>Vectors wouldn&#8217;t be very useful or efficient, though, if we could only obtain <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html">copies</a> or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html">clones</a> of their elements.
As this is an inherent limitation of Rust&#8217;s memory model, and applies to <em>all</em> compound types
(structs, hashmaps, etc.), it&#8217;s been recognized and countermeasures are&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>However, the <a href="http://is.gd/o3GRnw">idiomatic practice</a> is to actually leave the elements be and access them
solely through&nbsp;references:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">get_name</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">names</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">vec</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Smith&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">()];</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">clone</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>The obvious downside of this approach is that it requires an interface change to <code>join</code>: it now has to accept
pointers instead of actual objects<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. And since the result is a completely new <code>String</code>, we have to either bite
the bullet and <code>clone</code>, or write a more awkward <code>join_into(a: &amp;mut String, b: &amp;String)</code> function.<br/>
In general, making an <span class="caps">API</span> switch from actual objects to references has an annoying tendency to percolate up
the call stacks and abstraction&nbsp;layers.</p>
<h4>Vector&nbsp;solution</h4>
<p>If we still insist on moving the elements out, at least in case of vector we aren&#8217;t <em>completely</em> out of luck.
The <code>Vec</code> type offers several specialized methods that can slice, dice, and splice the collection in various ways.
Those&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.split_first"><code>split_first</code></a> (and <code>split_first_mut</code>)
for cutting right after the first&nbsp;element</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.split_last"><code>split_last</code></a> (and <code>split_last_mut</code>)
for a similar cut right before the last&nbsp;element</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.split_at"><code>split_at</code></a> (and <code>split_at_mut</code>),
generalized versions of the above&nbsp;methods</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.split_off"><code>split_off</code></a>, a partially-in-place version
of <code>split_at_mut</code></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.drain"><code>drain</code></a> for moving all elements from a specified&nbsp;range</li>
</ul>
<p>Other types may offer different methods, depending on their particular data layout, though <code>drain</code> should be available
on any data structure that can be iterated&nbsp;over.</p>
<h4>Structural&nbsp;advantage</h4>
<p>What about user-defined types, such as <code>struct</code>s?</p>
<p>Fortunately, these are covered by the compiler itself. Since accessing <code>struct</code> fields is a fully compile-time
operation, it is possible to track the ownership of each individual object that makes up the structure.
Thus there are no obstacles to simply <a href="http://is.gd/ZUI2Mn">moving all the fields</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">first_name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">last_name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">get_name</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">first_name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">                   </span><span class="n">last_name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Smith&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">()};</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">first_name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">last_name</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<h4>If all else&nbsp;fails&#8230;</h4>
<p>This leaves us with some rare cases when the container&#8217;s interface doesn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> support the exact subset of elements
we want to move out. If we don&#8217;t want to <code>drain</code> them all and inspect every item for potential preservation,
it may be time to skirt around the more dangerous areas of the&nbsp;language.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t necessarily mean going all out with <code>unsafe</code> blocks, pointers, and (let&#8217;s be honest) segfaults.
Instead, we can look at the gray zone between them and the regular, borrow-checked Rust&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Some of the functions inside the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/index.html"><code>std::mem</code> module</a> can be said
to fall into this category. Most notably, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.swap.html"><code>mem::swap</code></a> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.replace.html"><code>mem::replace</code></a> allow us to operate directly on the memory blocks
that back every Rust object, albeit without the dangerous ability to freely modify&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>What those functions enable is a small sleight of hand &#8212; a quick exchange of two variables or objects
while the borrow checker &#8220;isn&#8217;t looking&#8221;. Possessing such an ability, we can smuggle any item out of a container
as long as we&#8217;re able to provide a suitable&nbsp;replacement:</p>

  <div>
      <p>A relatively little known feature of Python is the <code>else</code> block for control flow statements other than <code>if</code>.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard about it before, you can provide such a block for both <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops,
as well as any variant of the <code>try</code> statement, Its functionality is roughly analogous in both&nbsp;cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>in loops, the <code>else</code> block is executed if the loop didn&#8217;t exit abnormally (i.e. with <code>break</code>)</li>
<li>in <code>try</code> constructs, the <code>else</code> block runs if <em>no</em> exception&nbsp;happened</li>
</ul>
<p>Likely because of the unique semantics that don&#8217;t exist in other languages, neither of those constructs has been seen much
in real world code. Recently, however, I&#8217;ve found they can be combined into a very pythonic pattern
that&#8217;s also quite&nbsp;useful.</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;trick</h4>
<p>Say you have a task that won&#8217;t always succeed. Perhaps it&#8217;s a request made to a janky server, or other network operartion
that&#8217;s prone to timeouts. Since failures are likely to be transient, you&#8217;d like to retry it several more times before
giving up&nbsp;permanently.</p>
<p>With <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> block, you can detect those half-expected failures. With a simple loop, you can repeat the attempt
for as many times as you deem feasible. Combined, they can solve the problem rather&nbsp;neatly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">MAX_RETRIES</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># ... do stuff ...</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">SomeTransientError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># ... log it, sleep, etc. ...</span>
        <span class="k">continue</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="n">PermanentError</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>But&nbsp;why?</h4>
<p>What&#8217;s the deal with the <code>else</code>s here, though? Are they both&nbsp;necessary?</p>
<p>The simple answer is of course no. <code>else</code> after either a loop or  <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> block is always a <em>syntactic sugar</em>.
Any code that contains it can be transformed into an equivalent snippet that utilizes different techniques to achieve
the same&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>But this view isn&#8217;t very useful, for many of the essential features in any programming languages can be dismissed
as superfluous using this reasoning. The real question is whether the above idiom is more readable and understandable
than the&nbsp;alternatives.</p>
<p>To that, I posit, the answer is: <em>absolutely</em>.</p>
<h4>Desugaring</h4>
<p>Without the double <code>else</code>, this example would have to be written in a considerably more convoluted&nbsp;way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">retries</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MAX_RETRIES</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">retries</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># ... do stuff ...</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">SomeTransientError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># ... log it, sleep, etc. ...</span>
        <span class="n">retries</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">retries</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="n">PermanentError</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Although at first glance the difference may be minuscule, this version adds significant extra busywork the programmer
has to pay careful attention&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>retries</code> variable now has to be explicit, because the final conditional statement must look at its&nbsp;value.</li>
<li>We can&#8217;t use a <code>for</code> loop anymore (e.g. <code>for retries in range(MAX_RETRIES)</code>), because we wouldn&#8217;t distinguish the
&#8220;success at last try&#8221; and &#8220;retry limit exceeded&#8221; cases: they&#8217;d both result in <code>retries</code> equal to <code>MAX_RETRIES - 1</code>
after the loop<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>As a result, we have to remember to decrement the counter ourselves upon an&nbsp;error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the <code>break</code> is easy to miss amidst the actual logic within the <code>try</code> block, both for developer
who writes the code and for any subsequent readers. An alternative is to move it outside of the <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> clause,
but that in turn reintroduces <code>continue</code> into the <code>except</code> branch and further complicates the whole&nbsp;flow.</p>
<p>In short, the desugared version is more error-prone (all those off-by-ones!) and also quite&nbsp;inscrutable.</p>

      <p>Having recently been writing some C++ code at work, I had once again experienced the kind of exasperation that this
cumbersome language evokes on regular basis. When I was working in it less sporadically, I was shrugging it off
and telling myself it&#8217;s all because of the low level it operates on. Superior performance was the other side of the deal,
and it was supposed to make all the trade-offs&nbsp;worthwhile.</p>
<p>Now, however, I realized that running close to the metal by no means excuses the sort of clunkiness that C++ permits.
For example, there really is no reason why the archaically asinine separation of header <span class="amp">&amp;</span> source files &#8212;
with its inevitable redundancy of declarations and definitions, worked around with Java-esque contraptions such as
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PimplIdiom">pimpl</a> &#8212; is still the bread and butter of C++ programs.<br/>
Same goes for the lack of sane dependency management, or a universal, portable build system. None of those would be
at odds with native compilation to machine code, or runtime speeds that are adequate for real-time&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>Rather than dwelling on those gripes, I thought it&#8217;d be more productive to look around and see what&#8217;s
the modern offerring in the domain of lower level, <em>really</em> fast languages. The search wasn&#8217;t long at all, because
right now it seems there is just one viable contender: Rust<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Rusty&nbsp;systems</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> introduces itself as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language">&#8220;systems programming language&#8221;</a>, which is quite a bold claim.
What followed the last time this phrase has been applied to an emerging language &#8212; Go &#8212; was a kind of
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Of-the-emerging-systems-languages-Rust-D-Go-and-Nim-which-is-the-strongest-language-and-why">word twisting</a>
that&#8217;s more indicative of politics, not computer&nbsp;science.</p>
<p>But Rust&#8217;s pretense to the system level is well justified. It clearly provides the requisite toolkit for working
directly with the hardware, be it <a href="https://github.com/miselin/rustic">embedded controllers</a> or
<a href="http://www.redox-os.org/">fully featured computers</a>. It offers compilation to native machine code;
direct memory access; running time guarantees thanks to the lack of <span class="caps">GC</span>-incuded stops;
and great interoperability through static and dynamic&nbsp;linkage.</p>
<p>In short, with Rust you can wreak havoc against the <span class="caps">RAM</span> and twiddle bits to your heart&#8217;s&nbsp;content.</p>
<h4>Safe and&nbsp;sound</h4>
<p>To be fair, though, the &#8220;havoc&#8221; part is not entirely accurate. Despite its focus on the low level, efficient computing,
Rust aims to be a very safe language. Unlike C, it actively tries to prevent the programmer from shooting themselves
in the foot &#8212; though it will hand you the gun if you but ask for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The safety guarantees provided by Rust apply to resource management, with the specific emphasis on memory
and pointers to it. The way that most contemporary languages deal with memory is by introducing a <em>garbage collector</em>
which mostly (though not wholly) relieves the programmer from thinking about allocations and deallocations.
However, the kind of global, stop-the-world garbage collections
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Na.C3.AFve_mark-and-sweep">mark-and-sweep</a>)
is costly and unpredictable, ruling it out as a mechanism for real-time&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>For this reason, Rust doesn&#8217;t mandate a <span class="caps">GC</span> of this kind<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. And although it offers mechanisms that are similar to
smart pointers from C++ (e.g. <code>std::shared_ptr</code>), it is actually preferable and <em>safer</em> to use regular, &#8220;naked&#8221; pointers:
<code>&amp;Foo</code> versus <code>Cell&lt;Foo&gt;</code> or <code>RefCell&lt;Foo&gt;</code> (which are some of the Rust&#8217;s &#8220;smart pointer&#8221;&nbsp;types).</p>
<p>The trick is in the clever compiler. As long as we use regular pointers, it is capable of detecting potential memory
bugs at <em>compilation time</em>. They are referred to as &#8220;data races&#8221; in Rust&#8217;s terminology, and include
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/references-and-borrowing.html#issues-borrowing-prevents">perennial problems</a>
that will segfault any C code which wasn&#8217;t written with utmost&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>Part of those safety guarantees is also the <em>default immutability</em> of references (pointers). The simplest reference
of type <code>&amp;Foo</code> in Rust translates to something like <code>const Foo * const</code> in C<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. You have to explicitly request
mutability with the <code>mut</code> keyword, and Rust ensures there is always at most one mutable reference to any value,
thus preventing problems caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_aliasing">pointer aliasing</a>.</p>
<p>But what if you really must sling raw pointers, and access arbitrary memory locations? Maybe you are programming
a microcontroller where I/O is done through a special memory region. For those occasions, Rust has got you covered
with the <code>unsafe</code> keyword:</p>

<p>Its usage, like in the above example, can be <em>very</em> localized, limited only to those places where it&#8217;s truly necessary
and guarded by the appropriate checks. As a result, the interface exposed by the above function
can be considered safe. The unrestricted memory access can be contained to where it&#8217;s really&nbsp;inevitable.</p>
<h4>Typing&nbsp;counts</h4>
<p>Ensuring memory safety is not the only way in which Rust differentiates itself from C.
What separates those two languages is also a few decades of practice and research into programming semantics.
It&#8217;s only natural to expect Rust to take advantage of this&nbsp;progress.</p>
<p>And advantage it takes. Although Rust&#8217;s type system isn&#8217;t nearly as advanced and complex like &#8212; say &#8212; Scala&#8217;s,
it exhibits several interesting properties that are indicative of its relatively modern&nbsp;origin.</p>
<p>First, it mixes the two most popular programming paradigms &#8212; functional and object-oriented &#8212; in roughly equal
concentrations, as opposed to being biased towards the latter. Rust doesn&#8217;t have interfaces or classes: it has <em>traits</em>
and their <em>implementations</em>. Even though they often fulfill similar purposes of abstraction and encapsulation,
these constructs are closer to the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class">type classes</a>
and their instances, which are found for example in&nbsp;Haskell.</p>
<p>Still, the more familiar notions of <span class="caps">OOP</span> aren&#8217;t too far off. Most of the key functionality of classes, for example,
can be simulated by implementing &#8220;default&#8221; traits for user-defined&nbsp;types:</p>

<p>The second aspect of Rust&#8217;s type system that we would come to expect from a new language is its expressive power.
<em>Type inference</em> is nowadays a staple, and above we can observe the simplest form of it. But it extends further,
to generic parameters, closure arguments, and closure return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>Generics, by the way, are quite nice as well. Besides their applicability to structs, type aliases, functions,
traits, trait implementations, etc., they allow for constraining their arguments with traits. This is similar to
the abandoned-and-not-quite-revived-yet idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_%28C%2B%2B%29">concepts in C++</a>,
or to an analogous mechanism from&nbsp;C#.</p>
<p>The third common trend in contemporary language design is the use of type system to solve common tasks.
Rust doesn&#8217;t go full Haskell and opt for monads for everything, but its <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> types are evidently
the functional approach to error handling<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. To facilitate their use, a powerful
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/patterns.html"><em>pattern matching</em> facility</a> is also present in&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<h4>Unexpectedly&nbsp;pythonic</h4>
<p>If your general go-to language is Python, you will find Rust a very nice complement and possibly a valuable instrument
in your coding arsenal. Interoperability between Python and Rust is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/rust-inside-other-languages.html#python">stupidly easy</a>,
thanks to both the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/ctypes.html"><code>ctypes</code> module</a> and the extreme simplicity
of creating portable,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/rust-inside-other-languages.html#a-rust-library">shared libraries</a> in Rust.
Offloading some expensive, <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock"><span class="caps">GIL</span></a>-bypassing computation to a fast,
native code written in Rust can thus be a relatively painless way of speeding up crucial parts of a Python&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>But somewhat more surprisingly, Rust has quite a few bits that seem to be directly inspired by Python semantics.
Granted, those two languages are conceptually pretty far apart in general, but the analogies are&nbsp;there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/iterators.html">iterators</a> in Rust is very similar to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-iterable">iterables</a> in Python. Even the <code>for</code> loop is basically identical:
rather than manually increment a counter, both in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/loops.html#for">Rust</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop">Python</a> you iterate over a <em>range of numbers</em>.<br/>
Oh, and both languages have an <code>enumerate</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/loops.html#enumerate">method</a>/
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate">function</a> that yields pairs of <code>(index, element)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/method-syntax.html#method-calls">method definition</a>
in Rust uses the <code>self</code> keyword as first argument to distinguish between instance methods and &#8220;class&#8221;/&#8221;static&#8221; methods
(or <em>associated functions</em> in Rust&#8217;s parlance).
This is even more pythonic than in actual Python, where <code>self</code> is technically just a convention,
albeit an extremely strong&nbsp;one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In either language, overloading operators doesn&#8217;t use any new keywords or special syntax,
like it does in C++, C#, and others. Python accomplishes it through <code>__magic__</code> methods, whereas Rust
has very similarly named <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/operators-and-overloading.html">operator traits</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust basically <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/documentation.html#documentation-as-tests">has <code>doctest</code></a>.
If you don&#8217;t know, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html"><code>doctest</code> module</a> is a standard Python testing
utility that can run usage examples found in documentation comments and verify their correctness. Rust version (<code>rustdoc</code>)
is even more powerful and flexible, allowing for example to mark additional boilerplate lines that should be run
when testing examples, but <em>not</em> included in the generated&nbsp;documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the list doesn&#8217;t end here and will grow over time. As of this writing, for example, nightly builds of Rust
already offer <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/slice-patterns.html">advanced slice pattern matching</a> which are
very similar to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/">extended iterable unpacking</a> from Python&nbsp;3.</p>
<h4>Is it worth&nbsp;it?</h4>
<p>Depending on your background and the programming domain you are working in, you may be wondering if Rust
is a language that&#8217;s worth looking into now, or in the near&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Firstly, let me emphasize that it&#8217;s still in its early stages. Although the stable version 1.0 has been released
<a href="http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html">a good couple of months ago</a>, the ecosystem isn&#8217;t nearly as diverse
and abundant as in some of the other new&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>If you are specifically looking to deploying Rust-written <span class="caps">API</span> servers, backends, and other &#8212; shall I use the word
&#8212; microservices, then right now you&#8217;ll probably be better served by more established solutions,
like Java with <a href="http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/">fibers</a>, asynchronous Python on PyPy, Erlang,
Go, node.js, or similar.
I predict Rust catching up here in the coming months, though, because the prospect of writing native speed <span class="caps">JSON</span> slingers
with relative ease is just too compelling to&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>The other interesting area for Rust is <em>game programming</em>, because it&#8217;s one of the few languages capable of supporting
even the most demanding <span class="caps">AAA</span>+ productions. The good news is that portable, open source
<a href="http://www.piston.rs/">game engines</a> are already here. The bad news is that most of the existing knowledge
about designing and coding high performance games is geared towards writing (stripped down) C++. The community
is also rather <del>stubborn</del> reluctant to adopt anything that may carry even a <em>hint</em> of potentially unknown
performance implications. Although some inroads have been made (here&#8217;s, for example,
an <a href="https://github.com/HeroesGrave/ecs-rs">entity component system</a> written in Rust), and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
to see indie games written in Rust, it probably won&#8217;t take over the industry anytime&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware, though, Rust may already have the upper hand. It is obviously much easier language to program in
than pure C. Along with its toolchain&#8217;s ability to produce
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/no-stdlib.html">minimal executables</a>, it makes for a compelling language for
programming microcontrollers and other embedded&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>So in short, Rust is pretty nice. And if you have read that far, I think you should just go ahead
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">have a look</a> for yourself&nbsp;:)</p>
