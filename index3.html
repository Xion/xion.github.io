  <div>
      <p>Rust is one of those nice languages with <em>pattern matching</em>.
If you don&#8217;t know, it can be thought of as a generalization of the <code>switch</code> statement:
comparing objects not just by value (or overloaded equality operator, etc.)
but by <em>structure</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">match</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hashmap</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">do_something_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">None</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">panic</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Oh noes!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>It doesn&#8217;t end here. As you can see above, objects can also be
<em>destructured</em> during the match (<code>Some(value)</code>),
their parts assigned to <em>bindings</em> (<code>value</code>),
and those bindings can subsequently be used in the <code>match</code> branch.</p>
<p>Neat? Definitely.
In Rust, pattern matching is bread-and-butter of not only the <code>match</code> statement,
but also <code>for</code>, (<code>if</code>)<code>let</code>, and even ordinary function&nbsp;arguments.</p>
<h4>Mixing in Rust&nbsp;semantics</h4>
<p>For a long time, however, I was somewhat confused as to what happens
when references and borrowing is involved in matching.
The two &#8220;operators&#8221; that often occur there are <code>&amp;</code> (ampersand) and <code>ref</code>.</p>
<p>You should readily recognize the first one,
as it is used pervasively in Rust to create references (and reference types).
The second one quite obviously hints towards references as well.
Yet those two constructs serve <em>very</em> different purposes when used within a&nbsp;pattern.</p>
<p>To add to the confusion, they are quite often encountered&nbsp;together:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hyper</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Url</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="c1">// print query string params of some URL</span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Url</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_url</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">query_params</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">query_pairs</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">unwrap_or</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">vec</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">[]);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">ref</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">ref</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">query_params</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;{}={}&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Lack of one or the other will be (at best) pointed out to you by the compiler,
along with a suggestion where to add it.
But addressing problems in this manner can only go so far.
So how about we delve deeper and see what it&#8217;s really&nbsp;about?</p>
<h4>Part of the reference, part of the&nbsp;pattern</h4>
<p>Rust is very flexible as to what value can be a subject of pattern matching.
You would be very hard pressed to find anything that <em>cannot</em> be used within a <code>match</code> statement, really.
Both actual objects and references to objects are perfectly&nbsp;allowed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">match</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Matched!&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the latter case, however, we aren&#8217;t typically interested in the reference itself (like above).
Instead, we want to determine some facts about the object it <em>points</em>&nbsp;to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">match</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Matched with number {}&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, this is where the ampersand comes into play.
Just like a type constructor (<code>Some</code>, <code>Ok</code>, or <code>Foo</code> above),
the <code>&amp;</code> operator informs the Rust compiler what kind of value we&#8217;re expecting from the match.
When it sees the ampersand, it knows we&#8217;re looking for <em>references</em> to certain objects,
and not for the objects&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>Why is the distinction between an object and its reference important, though?
In many other places, Rust is perfectly happy to blur the gap between references and actual objects<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> &#8212;
for example when calling most of their&nbsp;methods.</p>
<p>Pattern matching, however,
due to its ability to unpack values into their constituent parts,
is a <em>destructive</em> operation. Anything we apply <code>match</code> (or similar construct) to
will be <em>moved</em> into the block by&nbsp;default:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">maybe_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">from</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Alice&quot;</span><span class="p">));</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="k">match</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">maybe_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, {}&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{},</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">do_something_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">maybe_name</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Following the typical <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html">ownership semantics</a>,
this will prevent any subsequent moves and essentially consume the&nbsp;value:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>error: use of partially moved value: `maybe_name` [E0382]
    do_something_with(maybe_name);
                      ^~~~~~~~~~
</pre></div>


<p>So just like the aforementioned type constructors (<code>Some</code>, etc.),
the ampersand operator is simply <em>part of the pattern</em> that we match against.
And just like with <code>Some</code> and friends, there is an obvious symmetry here:
if <code>&amp;</code> was used to create the value, it needs to be used when unpacking&nbsp;it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The syntax used in a pattern that destructures an object
is analogous to one used by the expression which created&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Preventing the&nbsp;move</h4>
<p>Errors like the one above often contain helpful&nbsp;notes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>note: `(maybe_name:core::option::Option::Some).0` moved here because it has type `collections::string::String`, which is moved by default
         Some(n) =&gt; println!(&quot;Hello, {}&quot;, n),
              ^
</pre></div>


<p>as well as hints for resolving&nbsp;them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>help: if you would like to borrow the value instead, use a `ref` binding as shown:
        Some(ref n) =&gt; println!(&quot;Hello, {}&quot;, n),
</pre></div>


<p>Here&#8217;s where <code>ref</code> enters the&nbsp;scene.</p>
<p>The message tells us that if we add a <code>ref</code> keyword in the suggested spot,
we will switch from moving to <em>borrowing</em> for the <code>match</code> binding that follows (here, <code>n</code>).
It will still capture its value exactly as before,
but it will no longer assume <em>ownership</em> of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>This is the crucial&nbsp;difference.</p>
<p>Unlike the ampersand, <code>ref</code> is <strong>not</strong> something we match against.
It doesn&#8217;t affect what values match the pattern it&#8217;s in, and what values don&#8217;t<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The only thing it changes is how parts of the matched value
are <em>captured</em> by the pattern&#8217;s&nbsp;bindings:</p>
<ul>
<li>by default, without <code>ref</code>, they are <em>moved</em> into the <code>match</code> arms</li>
<li>with <code>ref</code>, they are <em>borrowed</em> instead and represented as&nbsp;references</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at our example, the <code>n</code> binding in <code>Some(n)</code> is of type <code>String</code>:
the actual field type from the matched structure.
By contrast, the other <code>n</code> in <code>Some(ref n)</code> is a <code>&amp;String</code> &#8212;
that is, a <em>reference</em> to the&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>One is a move, the other one is a&nbsp;borrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ref</code> annotates pattern bindings to make them borrow rather than move.
It is <em>not</em> a part of the pattern as far as matching is&nbsp;concerned.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Used&nbsp;together</h4>
<p>To finish off, let&#8217;s untangle the confusing example from the beginning of this&nbsp;post:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">ref</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">ref</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">query_params</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;{}={}&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Since we know <code>ref</code> doesn&#8217;t affect whether or not the pattern matches,
we could just as well have something like <code>&amp;(a, b)</code>.
And this should be quite a bit easier to read:
it clearly denotes we expect a reference to a 2-tuple of simple objects.
Not coincidentally,
such tuples are items from the vector we&#8217;re iterating&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>Problem is,
without the <code>ref</code>s we will attempt to <em>move</em> those items into the loop scope.
But due to the way the vector is iterated over (<code>&amp;query_params</code>),
we&#8217;re only <em>borrowing</em> each item, so this is actually impossible.
In fact, it would be a classic attempt to move out of a borrowed&nbsp;context.</p>
<p>It is also wholly unnecessary.
The only thing this loop does is printing the items out,
so accessing them through references is perfectly&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what the <code>ref</code> operator gives us.
Adding the keyword back,
we will switch from moving the values to just borrowing them&nbsp;instead.</p>
<h4>To sum&nbsp;up</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>&amp;</code> denotes that your pattern <strong>expects a reference</strong> to an object.
Hence <code>&amp;</code> is a part of said pattern:
<code>&amp;Foo</code> matches <em>different</em> objects than <code>Foo</code> does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> indicates that you want a <strong>reference to an unpacked value</strong>.
It is <em>not</em> matched against:
<code>Foo(ref foo)</code> matches <em>the same</em> objects as <code>Foo(foo)</code>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>The technical term for this is
a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/deref-coercions.html"><em><code>Deref</code> coercion</em></a>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>We can say that it doesn&#8217;t affect the <em>satisfiability</em>
(or conversely, <em>refutability</em>) of the pattern.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p><em>&#8230;not for standalone programs&nbsp;anyway.</em></p>
<p>Chances are, you have written some command line programs in Python. This is quite probable even if you normally code
in some other language. And if you have, it is not unlikely that you needed to parse the <code>argv</code> of your program at one
point or&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>There are plenty of options here, both in the standard library as well as among third party packages. One does stand out,
however, and it&#8217;s mostly for how it is often overused. I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://click.pocoo.org/">Click</a>&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use it in your next Python program, I hereby urge you to&nbsp;reconsider.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s the&nbsp;fuss?</h4>
<p><img style="float:right; margin-left: 8px; margin: bottom: 7px" src="http://xion.io/images/click-logo.png" alt="click_">
The somewhat bizarrely named Click library is described as a &#8220;package for creating beautiful
command line interfaces&#8221;. Its main trick is the ability to create subcommands by adorning Python functions with the
<code>@click.command()</code> decorator<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It then makes them coalesce into an argument parser, equipped with the necessary
dispatching&nbsp;logic.</p>
<p>This idea isn&#8217;t new, of course. Prior art goes back at least seven years to the now-abandoned
<a href="https://opster.readthedocs.io">opster</a> package. Click, however, was the first one of its kind to garner noticeable
popularity, which is easily attributed to <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/">whom it&#8217;s been authored by</a>.</p>
<p>So while my arguments against using this kind of <span class="caps">CLI</span> framework would apply to any package implementing the paradigm,
it just happens that Click is currently its most prominent example. Purely for the sake of convenience, I will therefore
refer to it as if it was interchangeable with the whole concept. Because why not? Whatever you may say about
the library&#8217;s name, it&#8217;s hard to imagine a more concise moniker than a simple <em>Click</em>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong, then, with the way Click handles command line&nbsp;interfaces?</p>
<h4><span class="caps">CLI</span>: Little&nbsp;Interfaces</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s how it encourages to treat them as an <em>accidental afterthought</em> rather than a deliberate design&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>For applications invoked repeatedly from a terminal, their command line arguments and flags are the primary means of
user interaction<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It is how users communicate their intent to perform an action; provide the neccessary input data
to carry it throgh; decide how they want to receive the output; and control many other aspects of the programs execution.
Absent graphical components and widgets, the command line is virtually the only way to interact with a terminal&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>In other words, it is <strong>the <span class="caps">UI</span></strong>.</p>
<p>And how important the <span class="caps">UI</span> is for <em>any</em> application? It seems to be important enough that entire fields of study are devoted
to reducing friction of human-computer interaction. In many projects, the emphasis on user interface design is on par
with that of actual software engineering.<br>
Like everything, of course, it is susceptible to trends and fads (such as the recent &#8220;mobile/responsive everything!&#8221;
craze). But its significance remains undiminished. Quite the opposite: in the age of ubiquitous computing,
user interfaces are probably more important than&nbsp;ever.</p>
<p>Yes, this includes <span class="caps">CLI</span>. One of the main reasons we turn to the command line are <em>speed</em> and <em>efficacy</em>. Common tasks must
utilize short and convenient syntax that is quick to integrate into user&#8217;s muscle memory. Others should not only be
possible, but <em>discoverable</em> and <em>accessible</em> without going through reams of <code>man</code> pages.</p>
<p>Any terminal program intended for frequent use by humans should therefore strive to excel in those two qualities.
But except for <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/echo">the simplest of cases</a>, it won&#8217;t happen by itself.
Designing an efficient <span class="caps">CLI</span> for any non-trivial application is a challenging and demanding&nbsp;task.</p>
<h4>It doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;click</h4>
<p>With Click, however, we&#8217;re encouraged to just wing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Click tells us to slap some decorators on our top-level functions and call it a day. Sure, you can dig deep enough
and uncover the underlying layers of abstraction that may eventually allow you do things for which <code>argparse</code> has
a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#mutual-exclusion">first-class support</a>.</p>
<p>By default, however, Click shoehorns your programs into
<a href="http://click.pocoo.org/5/quickstart/#basic-concepts">predefined patterns</a> that, incidentally, mirror those of some
<a href="http://click.pocoo.org/5/complex/#building-a-git-clone">least intuitive</a> command-line tools in&nbsp;existence.</p>
<p>Indeed, the whole idea of subdiving your program into several distinct is already suspect, for it appears at odds
with the fundamental Unix philosophy of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well">doing one thing well</a>. While it is
occasionally justified, it shouldn&#8217;t be the first thing that comes to your mind. But that&#8217;s completely at odds with the
Click&#8217;s approach, where <em>not</em> ending up with multiple distinct commands is something you have to consciously&nbsp;avoid.</p>
<h4>&#8230;though it sometimes&nbsp;might</h4>
<p>So, what <em>am</em> I suggesting you use instead libraries such as Click?&#8230; Nothing outrageous,&nbsp;really.</p>
<p>If you care about your command line interface, consider just using
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">the <code>argparse</code> module</a>. Yes, it will force you to create parser objects,
add arguments <span class="amp">&amp;</span> flags to it, and in general pay some attention to the whole business. When it comes to <span class="caps">UI</span>, it&#8217;s always
good to make it an explicit concern, maybe even sufficient to warrant
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/e86af37388573f00a4d6f282feca76ead88725d8/gisht/args/parser.py">its own module</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <a href="https://github.com/docopt/docopt"><code>docopt</code> library</a> provides another take on the <span class="caps">UI</span>-first approach
to <span class="caps">CLI</span>, though it is more limited in its capabilities<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;m not advocating to ditch Click in <em>all</em> scenarios. There&#8217;s plenty of situations when we&#8217;re interested in
getting <em>any</em> <span class="caps">CLI</span> up and running, and not so much in making the most efficient and intuitive interface possible. The prime
example is any kind of automation scripts that are ancillary to some bigger project, like <em>manage.py</em> is in Django<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
The Python ecosystem doesn&#8217;t really have dedicated task runners that are as featureful as <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a>
or <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>, and that makes Click a viable and compelling option<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But for standalone programs whose <span class="caps">CLI</span> is the main interface? Yeah, not&nbsp;really.</p>
<div class="footnote">

<p>Oddly enough, that pair of parentheses seems to be mandatory.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>Environment variables and config files deserve a honorary mention, of course. But those are usually derivatives of

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Python&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html">mocking library</a> is rather uncomplicated.
Most of what it does is creating <em>mock objects</em>: veritable sponges that absorb every interaction with any code
that we pass them&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>This simplicity is also surfaced in the <span class="caps">API</span>, especially in the main part of it &#8212; the <code>mock.Mock</code> constructor:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;http://example.com&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">some_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;http://example.com&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Any arguments that we pass there become attributes on the resulting mock object. This is really useful when
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#the-patchers">patching</a>, because it allows us to completely specify
the replacement object within a <code>@mock.patch</code> decorator:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@patch.object</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">requests</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;get&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">new</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">return_value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">status_code</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">400</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_404</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertRaises</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NotFoundError</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">do_stuff</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You have to keep in mind, however, that the <code>mock.Mock</code> class also has some
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock">constructor arguments</a> of its own.
For this reason, there exists some potential for name collision: some of the <code>Mock</code><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>s own arguments may have the same
names as the <em>attributes</em> we&#8217;d like to set on the mock&nbsp;object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c"># doesn&#39;t set the `name` attribute</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">some_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span>  <span class="c"># blows up!</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, the <code>name</code> argument is inherent to the <code>Mock</code> class. Its constructor will interpret it in a special way,
and so it <em>won&#8217;t</em> set a <code>name</code> attribute on the resulting mock. Other possible culprits include the <code>spec</code> and <code>wraps</code>
parameters, both of which have relatively common names that we may want to use as object attributes<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Collision&nbsp;avoidance</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s trivial to fix the issue, of&nbsp;course:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">some_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">sock_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>but this approach has a downside. Creating and configuring a mock is no longer a single expression, which means we cannot
use it with patchers as easily as&nbsp;before:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@patch.object</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mock_bar</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">mock_bar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span>
    <span class="c"># (...rest of the test...)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We can either configure the mock after patching, like above, or perhaps introduce some utility functions to be called
inside the <code>@patch</code> decorator.</p>
<h4>The almost-there&nbsp;method</h4>
<p>In any case, this is somewhat disappointing. And it is even more so when we discover that there is
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.configure_mock">a method called <code>configure_mock</code></a>
which <em>looks</em> like it was designed to solve this very issue. Its arguments are always interpreted as attributes
of the mock: it has no &#8220;special&#8221; or &#8220;reserved&#8221; names. Indeed, this method is what allows us to actually
write the mock setup as a single&nbsp;expression:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure_mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Problem is, this expression returns <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>Yes, <code>configure_mock</code> returns nothing.<br>
Or in other words, it doesn&#8217;t return anything.<br>
In fact, it has <a href="https://github.com/testing-cabal/mock/blob/286792b2cd5b5baa8338260538ed207391280e34/mock/mock.py#L671">no <code>return</code> statement</a>&nbsp;whatsoever.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it doesn&#8217;t have the <code>return self</code> line that&#8217;d enable us to write&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">some_mock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure_mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;John Doe&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Well, that is <em>quite</em> a&nbsp;let-down.</p>
<h4>Fixing&nbsp;it</h4>
<p>But hey, this is Python! Shortcomings like that don&#8217;t necessarily mean we have to fork whole libraries.
Let&#8217;s just add the missing <code>return</code>, shall&nbsp;we?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">mock</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Mock</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">_Mock</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_Mock</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">configure_mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure_mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span>  <span class="c"># &lt;-- there!</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Whew, that was&nbsp;quick!</p>
<p>&#8230;Alright, that&#8217;s actually the <em>whole</em> fix, but it&#8217;s close. To complete it, we need to apply the same treatment to
three more <code>Mock</code> classes: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.MagicMock"><code>MagicMock</code></a>,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.NonCallableMock"><code>NonCallableMock</code></a>,
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.NonCallableMagicMock"><code>NonCallableMagicMock</code></a>.</p>
<p>A complete solution can be seen in <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/8b98733d4b6be354be0ebae815ebd22d">this gist</a>.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Collision may also occur with <code>mock.patch</code> constructs. The most likely offender there is probably
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch"><code>new</code> parameter</a>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p><em>&#8230;or: The Most Hideous Hack I&#8217;ve (Almost)&nbsp;Done</em></p>
<p>In <a href="http://github.com/Xion/callee">callee</a>, the <a href="http://callee.readthedocs.org">argument matcher library for Python</a> that
<a href="http://xion.io/post/news/callee-intro.html">I released recently</a>, there is this lovely
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/callee/blob/f695ff4e1c45bfd45445ebb8014a202029a93dce/callee/general.py#L55"><code>TODO</code> note</a>
for a seemingly simple feature. When using the
<a href="http://callee.readthedocs.org/en/stable/reference/general.html#callee.general.Matching"><code>Matching</code> construct</a>
with a simple <code>lambda</code> predicate:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mock_foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Matching</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>it would be great to see its <em>code</em> in the error message if the assertion fails. Right now it&#8217;s just going to say
something like <code>&lt;Matching &lt;function &lt;lambda&gt; at 0x7f5d8a06eb18&gt;&gt;</code>. Provided you don&#8217;t possess a supernatural ability
of dereferencing pointers in your head, this won&#8217;t give you any immediate hint as to what went wrong. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice
if it read as, say, <code>&lt;Matching \x: x % 2&gt;</code> instead?<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So I thought: why not try and implement such a mechanism? This is Python, after all &#8212; a language where you can spawn
<a href="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2015/02/09/understanding-python-metaclasses/#simple-metaclass-use">completely new classes</a>
at runtime, walk the stack <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html#the-interpreter-stack">backwards</a>
(or even <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.settrace">forward</a>) and read the local variables,
or change the behavior of the <a href="http://xion.org.pl/2012/05/06/hacking-python-imports/">import system itself</a>.
Surely it would be possible &#8212; nay, easy &#8212; to get the source code of a short lambda function,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Boy, was I <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, though: the task turned out to be absolutely doable, at least in the scope I wanted it done.
But what would you think of a solution that involves not just the usual Python hackery, but also <span class="caps">AST</span> inspection,
transformations of the source code as text, <em>and</em> bytecode&nbsp;shenanigans?&#8230;</p>
<h4>The code, all the code, and&#8230; much more than the&nbsp;code</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning, though. Here&#8217;s a short lambda function, the kind of which we&#8217;d like to obtain
the source code&nbsp;of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">is_even</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If the documentation for Python standard library is to be believed, this should be pretty easy.
In the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html"><code>inspect</code> module</a>,
there is a function called no different than
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html#inspect.getsource"><code>getsource</code></a>. For our purposes, however,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/inspect.html#inspect.getsourcelines"><code>getsourcelines</code></a> is a little more
convienient, because we can easily tell when the lambda is too&nbsp;long:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_short_lambda_source</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lambda_func</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">source_lines</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">inspect</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getsourcelines</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lambda_func</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">IOError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_lines</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">source_lines</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Of course if you programmed in Python for any longer period of time, you know very well that the standard docs
are <em>not</em> to be trusted. And it&#8217;s not just that the <code>except</code> clause should also include <code>TypeError</code>, because it
will be thrown when you try to pass any of the Python builtins to <code>getsourcelines</code>.</p>
<p>More important is the ambiguity of what does &#8220;source lines for an object&#8221; actually mean. &#8220;Source lines <em>containing</em>
the object definition&#8221; would be much more accurate, and this seemingly small distinction is rather crucial here.
Passing a lambda function to either <code>getsourcelines</code> or <code>getsource</code>, we&#8217;ll get its source <em>and everything else</em>
that the returned lines&nbsp;included.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Say hello to the complete <code>is_even =</code> assignment, and the entire <code>assert_called_with</code> invocation!
And in case you are wondering: yes, the result will also include any end-of-line comments. No token left&nbsp;behind!</p>
<h4>Trim&nbsp;left</h4>
<p>Clearly this is more than we&#8217;ve bargained for. Maybe there is a way to strip away the unnecessary cruft? Python does
know how to parse itself, after all: the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html"><code>ast</code> module</a>
is a manifestation of this knowledge. Perhaps we can use it to retrieve the <code>lambda</code> <span class="caps">AST</span> node in order to turn it &#8212;
and just it &#8212; back into Python&nbsp;code?&#8230;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_short_lambda_ast_node</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lambda_func</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>


<p>But as it turns out, getting the source text back this way is only <em>mostly</em>&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>See, every substantial <span class="caps">AST</span> node &#8212; which is either an expression (<code>ast.expr</code>) or a statement (<code>ast.stmt</code>) &#8212;
has two common attributes: <code>lineno</code> and <code>col_offset</code>. When combined, they point to a place in the original source code
where the node was parsed from. This is how we can find out where to look for the definition of our lambda&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>Looks promising, right? The only problem is we don&#8217;t know when to <em>stop</em> looking.
That&#8217;s right: nodes created by <code>ast.parse</code> are annotated with their start offset, but not with length nor the end offset.
As a result, the best we can do when it comes to carving out the lambda source from the very first example is&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So close! Those hanging parentheses are evidently just taunting us, but how can we remove them? <code>lambda</code> is basically
just a Python expression, so in principle it can be followed by almost anything. This is doubly true for lambdas inside
the <code>Matching</code> construct, as they may be a part of some larger mock&nbsp;assertion:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mock_foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Matching</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">Integer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">GreaterThan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, the extraneous suffix is the entirety of <code>), Integer() &amp; GreaterThan(42))</code>, quite a lot of more than just <code>))</code>.
And that&#8217;s of course nowhere near the limit of possiblities: for one, there may be more <code>lambda</code>s in there,&nbsp;too!</p>
<h4>Back off, <em>slowly</em></h4>
<p>It seems, however, that there is one thing those troublesome tails have in common: <em>they aren&#8217;t syntactically valid</em>.</p>
<p>Intuitively, a <code>lambda</code> node nested within some other syntactical constructs will have their closing fragments (e.g. <code>)</code>)
appear somewhere after its end. Without the corresponding openings (e.g. <code>Matching(</code>), those fragments won&#8217;t&nbsp;parse.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the crazy idea. What we have is invalid Python, but only because of some unspecified number of extra characters.
How about we just try and remove them, one by one, until we get something that <em>is</em> syntactically correct?
If we are not mistaken, this will finally be our lambda and nothing&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>The fortune favors the brave, so let&#8217;s go ahead and try&nbsp;it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># ... continuing get_short_lambda_source() ...</span>

<span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Considering that we&#8217;re basically taking lessons from the dusty old tomes in the Restricted Section of Hogwarts library,
the magic here looks quite simple. As long as there is something that can pass for a lambda definition,
we try to parse it and see if it succeeds. The line that says <code>except SyntaxError:</code> is obviously not something for
the faint of heart, but at least we are specifying
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/doanddont.html#except"><em>what</em> exception</a> we anticipate&nbsp;catching.</p>
<p>And the kicker? It <em>works</em>. By that I mean it doesn&#8217;t return garbage results for a few obvious and not so obvious
test cases, which is already more than you would normally expect from hacks of this magnitude.
All the lambdas defined until this paragraph, for example, can have their source code extracted without&nbsp;issue.</p>
<h4>Just one more&nbsp;thing</h4>
<p>So&#8230; victory? Not quite. Astute readers may recall my promise of some bytecode arcana, and now&#8217;s the time for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Despite the initial success of our gradual, character dropping approach, there are cases where it doesn&#8217;t produce
the correct result. Consider, for example, a lambda definition that&#8217;s nestled within a tuple<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">get_short_lambda_source</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We would of course expect the result to be <code>lambda _: True</code>, without a comma or&nbsp;zero.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, here&#8217;s where our earlier assumption fails rather spectacularly. The line of code extracted from <span class="caps">AST</span>
is syntactically valid even <em>with</em> the extra characters. As a result, <code>ast.parse</code> succeeds too early and returns an
incorrect definition. It should have been of a lambda contained within a tuple, but tuple is apparently what the lambda
<em>returns</em>.</p>
<p>You may say that this is the sharp end of a narrow edge case, and anyone who defines functions like that deserves all
the trouble they get. And sure, I wouldn&#8217;t mind if we just threw hands in the air and told them we&#8217;re simply unable
to retrieve the source here. But my opinion is that it doesn&#8217;t justify serving them obviously <em>wrong</em>&nbsp;results!</p>
<h4>A halting&nbsp;problem</h4>
<p>Not if we can help it, anyway. Have a look at the expected source code and the one we&#8217;ve extracted, side by&nbsp;side:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The second line isn&#8217;t just longer: it is also <em>doing more</em>. It isn&#8217;t just defining a lambda; it defines it,
conjures up a constant <code>0</code>, and then packs them both into a tuple. That&#8217;s at least two additional steps compared to
the&nbsp;original.</p>
<p>Those steps have a more precise name, too: they are the <em>bytecode instructions</em>. Every piece of Python source is compiled
to a binary bytecode before it&#8217;s executed, because the interpreter can only work with this representation.
Compilation typically happens when a Python module is first imported, producing a <em>.pyc</em> file corresponding to its
<em>.py</em> file. Subsequent imports will simply reuse the cached&nbsp;bytecode.</p>
<p>Moreover, any function or class object has its bytecode accessible (read-only) at runtime. There is even a
<a href="http://late.am/post/2012/03/26/exploring-python-code-objects.html">dedicated data type</a> to hold it &#8212; called simply
<code>code</code> &#8212; with a buffer of raw bytes under one of its&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>Finally, the bytecode compiler itself is also available to Python programs as a built-in
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#compile"><code>compile</code> function</a>. You don&#8217;t see it used as often as its
counterparts <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval"><code>eval</code></a>
and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#exec"><code>exec</code></a> (which hopefully are a rare sight themselves!),
but it taps into the same internal machinery of&nbsp;Python.</p>
<p>So how does it all add up? The idea is, basically, to cross-check the alleged source code of the lambda with its own
<em>byte</em>code. Any junk that&#8217;s still left to trim &#8212; even if syntactically valid &#8212; will surface as a divergence after
compilation. Thus we can simply continue dropping characters until the bytecodes&nbsp;match:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">lambda_text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">source_text</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">lambda_node</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">col_offset</span><span class="p">:]</span>

            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">lambda_text</span>

<span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Okay, maybe not the exact bytes<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, but stopping at the identical bytecode <em>length</em> is good enough a strategy.
As an obvious bonus, <code>compile</code> will also take care of detecting syntax errors in the candidate source code,
so we don&#8217;t need the <code>ast</code> parsing&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<h4>That escalated&nbsp;quickly!</h4>
<p>Believe it or not, but there aren&#8217;t any more objections to this solution, You can view it in its glorious entirety
by looking at <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/617c1496ff45f3673a5692c3b0e3f75a">this gist</a>.</p>
<p>Does it mean it is also making its cameo in the <a href="https://github.com/Xion/callee"><em>callee</em> library</a>?&#8230;</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m afraid&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Normally, I&#8217;m not the one to shy away from, ahem, <em>bold</em> solutions to tough problems. But in this case, the magnitude
of hackery required is just too great, the result not satisfactory enough, the feature&#8217;s priority isn&#8217;t really
all that high, and the maintenance burden it&#8217;d introduce is most likely too&nbsp;large.</p>
<p>In the end, it was great fun figuring it out: yet another example of how you can fiddle with Python to do basically
anything. Still, we must not get too preoccupied with whether or not we can as to forget if we <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>Why we won&#8217;t always get an identical bytecode? The short answer is that some instructions may be swapped
for their approximate equivalents.<br/>
The long answer is that with <code>compile</code>, we aren&#8217;t able to replicate the exact closure environment of the original lambda.
When a function refers to an <em>free variable</em> (like <code>foo</code> in <code>lambda x: x + foo</code>), it is its closure where the value
for that variable comes from. For ad-hoc lambdas, this is typically the local scope of its <em>outer function</em>.</br>
Code produced by <code>compile</code>, however, isn&#8217;t associated with any such local scope. All free names are thus assumed
to refer to <em>global</em> variables. Because Python uses different bytecode instructions for referencing local and global
names (<code>LOAD_FAST</code> vs <code>LOAD_GLOBAL</code>), the result of <code>compile</code> may differ from a piece of bytecode produced in the regular
manner.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div>
      <p>Just like many other people, I was following news from the last week&#8217;s
<a href="https://build.microsoft.com/"><span class="caps">BUILD</span> conference</a> with piqued interest. The ability to run Linux userland programs
on Windows &#8212; including, of course,
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/be-very-afraid-hell-has-frozen-over-bash-is-coming-to-windows-10/">bash</a> &#8212;
is something to be excited about. If nothing else, it should dramatically improve Windows support of new programming
languages that seem to pop up all the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>There was something else, however, that I couldn&#8217;t help but notice. The reactions of tech communities to this and similar developments focused very frequently on Microsoft&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>The beloved &#8220;new Microsoft&#8221;,
as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4cqm9y/xamarin_becomes_free_and_opensource/d1kjwl8">some call it</a>,
embraces open source, supports Linux, and generally does almost a full 180 with their stance on
proprietary vs. free software. The circumstances fit this narrative rather snuggly, too: a new <span class="caps">CEO</span> makes a clean break
with the past to pivot the company in this new world ruled by mobile and&nbsp;cloud.</p>
<p>Still&#8230; <em>love</em>? Even considering how Internet comments are grotesquely exaggerated most of the time, that&#8217;s quite
a declaration. The sentiment is nowhere near isolated either. But it&#8217;s not a question whether this infatuation
has a rational merit, or whether those feelings will eventually turn out to be&nbsp;misplaced.</p>
<p>The question is: why does it exist at all? We are talking about a <em>company</em> here, a for-profit organization.
How can such a language even enter the&nbsp;picture?</p>
<p>Then I realized this is not really a new phenomenon. Quite the opposite: the broad developer community seems to
always need a company to champion its core values. Nowadays, we&#8217;re simply trying to find someone new
to carry the&nbsp;standard.</p>
<p>Why? Because we feel that our old heroes have forsaken&nbsp;us.</p>
<h4>Hall of past&nbsp;fame</h4>
<p>Take <strong>GitHub</strong> for example. Once a darling of the open source community, it&#8217;s been suffering sharp criticism
for many months now. Rightfully or not, many people aren&#8217;t exactly excited &#8212; to put it mildly &#8212; about changes to
the <a href="https://github.com/blog/2146-organizations-can-now-block-abusive-users">policy</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/blog/2039-adopting-the-open-code-of-conduct">atmosphere</a> at GitHub,
typified by the ill-fated <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/githubs-ceo-ditches-meritocracy-rug-2014-1">meritocracy rug</a>.
The widely backed and long standing <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github">plea for a few critical features</a>
has only recently stopped falling on deaf ears. And in the background, there are always concerns about GitHub simply
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10823128">becoming too big</a>, and exterting too much control over
the open source&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Nota bene</em>, the very same ecosystem it had once been lauded for&nbsp;nurturing.</p>
<p>Among the other flagship tech companies, <strong>Apple</strong> or <strong>Facebook</strong> have never garnered much good will. Sure, they are
recognized for the pure utilitarian value of hardware they produce; or convenience, broad applicability, and stability
of APIs they offer. Facebook may be scoring some additional points for trying to
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">sort out</a> the mess of frontend development, but many say it&#8217;s
<a href="https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.j740brod8">not doing anybody any favors</a>.
Neither company is easy to portray as a paragon of openness, though, and it&#8217;s probably easier to argue
<a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/apples-closed-ecosystem-threatening-derail-technological-revolution-1535944">the exact opposite</a>.</p>
<p>And then there is <strong>Google</strong>, of course<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Some time in the past few years, a palpable shift occurred in how
the company is perceived by the techie crowd. It&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint the exact pivotal moment, and the
<a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">one event that leaps to attention</a>
doesn&#8217;t seem sufficient to explain it. But the tone has been set,
allowing <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html">news</a> to be
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2yt73v/google_to_close_google_code_open_source_project/cpdb6xs">molded</a>
to fit it. Add this to the usual backdrop of complaints about the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ll864/my_horrible_google_interview_experience/">onerous</a>
interview process and general fearmongering, and the picture doesn&#8217;t look very&nbsp;bright.</p>
<h4>Shades of&nbsp;grey</h4>
<p>No similar woes seem to have been plaguing Microsoft as of late, even though their record of recent &#8220;unwholesome&#8221; deeds
isn&#8217;t exactly
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2447177/updategate-windows-10-is-resetting-default-apps-back-to-microsoft-stock">clean</a>
either. Does it mean they are indeed the most fitting candidate for a (new) enterprise ally of the hacker&nbsp;community?&#8230;</p>
<p>Or maybe we can finally recognize the whole notion as the utterly silly concept it actually is. Hard to shake though
it be, this quasi-Manicheic mentality of assigning labels of virtue or sin is, at best, a naive idealism. At worst,
it&#8217;s a peculiar kind of harmful partisanship that technologists are particularly susceptible to. You may recognize it
as something that has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">very long tradition</a> in the hacker&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a tradition worth&nbsp;keeping.</p>

  <div>
      <p>Here&#8217;s a trick that&#8217;s hardly new, but if you haven&#8217;t heard about, it will save you a trip to a man page or&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;re a person who mostly prefers the terminal over some fancy <span class="caps">GUI</span>, you&#8217;ve probably used the <code>find</code> command
along with <code>xargs</code> at least a few times. It&#8217;s very common, for example, to use the results of <code>find</code> as arguments
to some other program. It could something as simple as figuring out which modules in your project have grown
slightly too&nbsp;large:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ find . -name &#39;*.py&#39; | xargs wc -l | sort -hr
1467 total
 322 callee/base.py
 261 callee/general.py
 251 callee/collections.py
# etc.
</pre></div>


<p>We find them all first, and then use <code>xargs</code> to build a long <code>wc</code> invocation, and we finally display results
in the reverse order. Pretty easy stuff: I don&#8217;t usually have to try more than a dozen times to get it right!<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But how about the opposite situation? Let&#8217;s say you have a list of <em>directories</em> you want to search through with <code>find</code>.
Doing so may seem easy enough<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs find -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>Except it&#8217;s not going to work. Like a few other Unix commands, <code>find</code> is very particular about the order of arguments
it receives. Not only are the predicate flags (like <code>-name</code>) considered in sequence, but they also have to appear
<em>after</em> the directories we want to search&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>But in the <code>xargs</code> invocation above, essentially the opposite is going to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<h4>The replacement&nbsp;flag</h4>
<p>So how to remedy this? Enter the <code>-I</code> flag to <code>xargs</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>This flag will tell <code>xargs</code> quite a few&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>The most important one is to stop putting the arguments at the end of the command invocation.
Instead, it shall place them wherever it sees the <em>replacement string</em> &#8212; here, pair of braces<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: <code>{}</code>.
And because we placed the braces where <code>find</code> is normally expecting the list of directories to search through,
the command will now get us exactly the results we&nbsp;wanted.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s almost impossible to see, however, is that it may not use the exact <em>way</em> we intended to obtain those results.
The difference is easier to spot when we replace <code>find</code> with <code>echo</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat &gt;/tmp/list
foo
bar
$ cat /tmp/list | xargs echo
foo bar
$ cat /tmp/list | xargs -I{} echo {}
foo
bar
</pre></div>


<p>or, better yet, use <code>xargs</code> with the <code>-t</code> flag to print the commands on stderr before executing&nbsp;them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} -t find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39; &gt;/dev/null
find callee -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
find tests -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, we actually have more than one <code>find</code> invocation&nbsp;here!</p>
<p>This is the second effect of <code>-I</code>: it causes <code>xargs</code> to execute given command line <em>for each argument separately</em>.
It so happens that it doesn&#8217;t really make any difference for our usage of <code>find</code>, which is why it wasn&#8217;t at all obvious
we were running it multiple&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>To avoid problems, though, you should definitely be cognizant of this fact when calling other programs with <code>xargs -I</code>.</p>
<h4>Make arguments spaced&nbsp;again</h4>
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;m not aware of any method that&#8217;d actually make <code>xargs</code> produce <code>find foo bar -name ...</code> calls.
If you need this exact form, probably the easiest way is to use plain old shell&nbsp;variables:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find $d -name &#39;*.py&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>This takes advantage of the <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting">word splitting</a> feature of Bash and a few other
compatible shells. Caveat is, you may be using a shell where this behavior is disabled by default. The result would be
making <code>find</code> interpret the content of <code>$d</code> as a <em>single</em> directory name: <code>foo bar</code> rather than <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>.</p>
<p>zsh is one such shell. Although <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq03.html#l18">probably a good thing overall</a>,
in times like these you&#8217;d want to bring the &#8220;normal&#8221; behavior back. In zsh, it&#8217;s fortunately pretty&nbsp;simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find ${=d} -name &#39;*.py&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>What about a portable solution? As far as I can tell, the only certain way you can ensure word splitting occurs
is to use <code>eval</code>. Here, the <code>xargs</code> command can actually come in handy again, albeit only as a&nbsp;prop:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt | xargs echo); eval &quot;find $d -name &#39;*.py&#39;&quot;)
</pre></div>


<p>One would hope such hacks aren&#8217;t needed very&nbsp;often.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>A completely kosher version would also use the <code>-print0</code> flag to <code>find</code> and the <code>-0</code> flag to <code>xargs</code>.
It&#8217;s not necessary here because Python module files cannot contain spaces.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Purists shall excuse my use of <code>cat</code> here, it&#8217;s merely for illustrative purposes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>This use of braces in <code>find</code> has of course nothing to do with the <em>other</em> possible occurrences of <code>{}</code> there,
like in the <code>-exec</code> flag. Since you cannot force <code>find</code> to expect a different placeholder, you should use something else
for <code>xargs</code> in those cases, .e.g: <code>xargs -I^ find ^ -name '__main__.py' -exec 'python {}' \;</code>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>By now you have probably heard about the infamous &#8220;npm-gate&#8221; that swept through the developer community
over the last week. It has been
<a href="https://medium.com/@azerbike/i-ve-just-liberated-my-modules-9045c06be67c#.hp7p1aolc">brought up</a>,
<a href="https://medium.com/@mproberts/a-discussion-about-the-breaking-of-the-internet-3d4d2a83aa4d#.rlnh89inz">discussed</a>,
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/">covered</a>,
<a href="http://www.haneycodes.net/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program">meta-discussed</a>,
<a href="http://left-pad.io/">satirized</a>, and even featured by
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/npm-left-pad-controversy-explained-2016-3">some mainstream media</a>.
Evidently the nerds have managed to stir up some serious trouble again, and it only took them 11 lines of
that strange thing they call&nbsp;&#8220;code&#8221;.</p>
<h4>No good things in small&nbsp;packages</h4>
<p>When looking for a culprit, the one party that everyone pounced on immediately was of course
the <a href="http://npmjs.com">npm</a> itself. With its myriad of packages that could each fit in a tweet, it invites to create
the exact house of cards we&#8217;ve seen&nbsp;collapse.</p>
<p>This serves as a good wake-up call, of course. But it also compels to throw the baby out with the bathwater,
and draw a conclusion that may be a little too far-fetched. Like perhaps declaring the <em>entire idea</em> of
managing dependencies &#8220;the npm way&#8221; suspect. If packages tend to degenerate into something as ludicrous as
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/isarray"><code>isArray</code></a> &#8212; to say nothing of
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/left-pad"><code>left-pad</code></a>, which started the whole debacle &#8212; then maybe this approach
to software reusability has simply bankrupted&nbsp;itself?</p>
<h4>A world without&nbsp;*pm</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m right away responding to that with a resounding &#8220;No!&#8221;. Package management as a concept is not responsible for
the poor decision making of one specific developer collective. And anyone who might think tools like npm do more
harm than good I ask: have you recently written any&nbsp;C++?</p>
<p>See, C++ is the odd one among languages that at least pretend to be keeping up with the times. It doesn&#8217;t present
a package management story at all. That&#8217;s right &#8212; the C++ &#8220;ecosystem&#8221;, as it stands now,&nbsp;has:</p>
<ul>
<li>no package&nbsp;manager</li>
<li>no repository of&nbsp;packages</li>
<li>no unified way of managing&nbsp;dependencies</li>
<li>no way to isolate development environments of different projects from one&nbsp;another</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding any kind of third-party dependency to a C++ project &#8212; especially a portable one, which is allegedly one of C++&#8217;s
strengths &#8212; is a considerable pain, even when it doesn&#8217;t require any additional libraries by itself. And environment
isolation? Some people are using Linux containers (!) for this, which is like dealing with a mosquito by shooting it
with a&nbsp;howitzer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/carl-sagan.jpg" alt="Billions upon billions of lines"></br>
    <small>To build a C++ binary, you must first build the userspace.</small>
</p>

<p>But hey, at least they can use <code>apt-get</code>,&nbsp;right?&#8230;</p>
<p>So, string padding incidents aside, package managers are absolutely <em>essential</em>. Sure, we can and should discuss
the merits of their particular flavors and implementation details &#8212;like whether it&#8217;s prudent to allow &#8220;delisting&#8221;
of packages. As a whole, however, package managers deserve recognition as a crucial part of modern language tooling
that we cannot really do&nbsp;without.</p>

  <div>
      <p>Combined with dynamic typing, the lax object model of Python makes it pretty easy to write unit tests that involve
<em>mocking</em> some parts of the tested code. Still, there&#8217;s plenty of third party libraries &#8212; usually with &#8220;mock&#8221; somewhere
in the name &#8212; which promise to make it even shorter and simpler. There&#8217;s evidently been a need here that the standard
library didn&#8217;t address&nbsp;adequately.</p>
<p>It changed, however, with Python 3.3. This version introduced a new
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html"><code>unittest.mock</code> module</a> which essentially obsoleted
all the other, third party solutions. The module, available also as a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock">backport</a>
for Python 2.6 and above, is flexible, easy to use, and offers most if not all of the requisite&nbsp;functionality.</p>
<h4>Called it,&nbsp;maybe?</h4>
<p>Well, with one notable exception. If we mock a function, or any other callable&nbsp;object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># (production code)</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ProductionClass</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">florb</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c"># (test code)</span>
<span class="n">something</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ProductionClass</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">something</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">florb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Mock</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>we have very limited capabilities when it comes to verifying <em>how</em> they were called. Sure, we can be extremely&nbsp;specific:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">something</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">florb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;this particular string&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>or very&nbsp;lenient:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">something</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">florb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ANY</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c"># works for _any_ argument</span>
</pre></div>


<p>but there is virtually nothing in between. Suppose we don&#8217;t care too much what <em>exact</em> string the method was called with,
only that it was <em>some</em> string that&#8217;s long enough? Things get awkward <em>very</em> fast&nbsp;then:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">posargs</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">kwargs</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">something</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">florb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call_args_list</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">arg</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">posargs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertIsInstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertGreaterEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">break</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fail</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;required call to </span><span class="si">%r</span><span class="s"> not found&#39;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">something</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">florb</span><span class="p">,))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Yes, this is what&#8217;s required: an actual loop through all the mock&#8217;s calls<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>; unpacking tuples of positional and keyword
arguments; and manual assertions that won&#8217;t even emit useful error messages when they&nbsp;fail.</p>
<p>Eww! Surely Python can do better than&nbsp;that?</p>
<h4>Meet <code>callee</code></h4>
<p>Why, of course it can! Today, I&#8217;m releasing <a href="https://callee.readthedocs.org"><em>callee</em></a>: a library of <strong>argument matchers</strong>
compatible with <code>unittest.mock</code>. It enables you to write much simpler, more readable,
and delightfully declarative&nbsp;assertions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">callee</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">LongerOrEqual</span>
<span class="n">something</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">florb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">LongerOrEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The wide array of matchers offered by <em>callee</em> includes
<a href="https://callee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/numbers.html">numeric</a>,
<a href="https://callee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/strings.html">string</a>,
and <a href="https://callee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/collections.html">collection</a> ones.
And if none suits your particular needs,
it&#8217;s a trivial matter to <a href="https://callee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/custom-matchers.html">implement a custom one</a>.</p>
