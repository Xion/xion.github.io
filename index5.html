  <div>
      <p>In this post I&#8217;ll describe all (hopefully all!) the various ways you can specify a single dependency for a Python&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>This assumes <em>pip</em> is used for installation. The list of dependencies then goes either in <code>install_requires=</code>
parameter of the <code>setup</code> function within <em>setup.py</em>, or as a separate <em>requirements.txt</em> file. Commonly, it will actually
go in both places, with the latter being the canonical source of&nbsp;truth:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">setuptools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">setup</span>

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;requirements.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">rf</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="c"># ...</span>
        <span class="n">install_requires</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">rf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readlines</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>More details about this approach can be found in
<a href="http://xion.org.pl/2014/01/27/anathomy-of-a-python-package/">one of my previous posts</a>.</p>
<p>Here, I will concentrate on the format of a single line in <em>requirements.txt</em> that defines a dependency.
There are numerous variants that <em>pip</em> supports, and they are all described in excruciating detail in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/"><span class="caps">PEP</span> 440</a>. This post shall serve as a short reference on the most useful&nbsp;ones.</p>
<h4>Package name (and&nbsp;version)</h4>
<p>The simplest and most common option is to identify a dependency by its package&nbsp;name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy
</pre></div>


<p>This will locate it in a global index of packages, which is sometimes called a &#8220;cheese shop&#8221;. Currently,
by far the most popular package registry for Python is <a href="https://pypi.python.org">PyPI</a>, and <em>pip</em> uses it by default<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Without any further modifiers, <em>pip</em> will download and install the &#8220;current&#8221; version of the package &#8212; either the newest,
or the one designated explicitly by a maintainer. This obviously makes the dependency somewhat unpredictable,
for it can mean unintended upgrades that introduce breaking changes to your&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>To prevent this, you&#8217;d normally <em>pin</em> the dependency to an exact version<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy==0.9.10
</pre></div>


<p>Other comparison operators are also&nbsp;available:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy&gt;=0.9.10
SQLAlchemy&lt;1.0.0
</pre></div>


<p>and can even be&nbsp;combined:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy&gt;=0.9,&lt;1.0.0
</pre></div>


<p>Specs like that will make <em>pip</em> find the newest version that&#8217;s within given range. Assuming your dependency follows
the <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> scheme, this will allow you to stay on top of any minor bugfixes
and improvements to an older release (0.9.x here), without the risk of accidentally upgrading to a new one (1.x)
that your code is not compatible with&nbsp;yet.</p>
<h4>Repository <span class="caps">URL</span></h4>
<p>Sometimes you want to live on the bleeding edge, though, and depend not just on the latest <em>release</em>,
but the head <em>commit</em> to the package&#8217;s repository. This makes sense especially in large systems
that are distributed among multiple repos, and where development happens in&nbsp;lockstep.</p>
<p>For those occasions, and a few others, <em>pip</em> can recognize direct repository URLs. They are in the&nbsp;format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$VCS+$PROTOCOL://$URL@$LABEL#egg=$PACKAGE
</pre></div>


<p>where the <code>$PROTOCOL</code> part can be optional if the version control system has a default there. That&#8217;s for example
the case for <code>git</code>, which is of course the most important <span class="caps">VCS</span> you&#8217;d be interested in<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git://git.example.com/somepackage#egg=somepackage
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the <code>#egg=$PACKAGE</code> part is not a part of the <code>$URL</code>, and it&#8217;s only there to give a local name for the package
distribution. This is what makes it possible to refer to it later via <em>pip</em>, if only to remove it with
<code>pip uninstall $PACKAGE</code>.
Of course, the sanest practice is to use the PyPI moniker if&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>When no <code>$LABEL</code> is given, <em>pip</em> will use the <span class="caps">HEAD</span>, trunk, tip, or the equivalent default/current revision from the repo.
Often though (at least in case of Git), you would also pick a branch, tag, or even a particular <em>commit hash</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git+https://github.com/Xion/unmatcher.git@0.1.3.1#egg=unmatcher
git+ssh://github.com/You/yourpackage.git@master#egg=yourpackage
git+https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2.git@5b498453b5898257b2287f14ef6c363799f1405a#egg=Jinja2
</pre></div>


<p>The last two options could be a good choice even with third party packages, when you don&#8217;t want to wait for a new PyPI
release to get a necessary feature or an urgent bug&nbsp;fix.</p>
<h4>Local&nbsp;filesystem</h4>
<p>Lastly, you can ask <em>pip</em> to install a package from a local directory or archive. The former option is often used
with the <code>-e</code> (<code>--editable</code>) flag for <code>pip install</code>. This installs the package in the so-called <em>development mode</em>,
allowing you to edit its source code&nbsp;in-place:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ pip install -e /home/me/Code/myotherpackage
</pre></div>


<p>You almost certainly don&#8217;t want to put this line in <em>requirements.txt</em>: you should still be pulling the other package
from PyPI. But if it&#8217;s your own one  &#8212; maybe a self-contained utility library used by your main program &#8212;
this setup will be very helpful for making changes to it, informed by your own usage of the&nbsp;package.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>This can be changed with <code>--index_url</code> flag to <code>pip install</code>. Running local indexes is a good practice
for Python shops, especially those that rely on <code>pip install</code> as part of their deployment process.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>If the package uses <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, a possible alternative to <code>==</code> is <code>~=</code>,
which means &#8220;compatible&#8221; version. The precise meaning of this is
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#compatible-release">somewhat complicated</a>, but it roughly means that upgrades
are permitted as long as nothing in the public interface changes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div>
      <p>To prevent the kind of memory errors that plagues many C programs,
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html"><em>borrow checker</em> in Rust</a> tracks how data is moved between variables,
or accessed via references. This is all done at compile time, with zero runtime overhead, and is a sizeable part
of Rust&#8217;s value&nbsp;offering.</p>
<p>Like all rigid and automated systems, however, it is necessarily constrained and cannot handle all situations perfectly.
One of its limitations is treating all objects as <em>atomic</em>. It&#8217;s impossible for a variable to own a part of some bigger
structure, neither is it possible to maintain mutable references to two or more elements of a&nbsp;collection.</p>
<p>If we nonetheless <a href="http://is.gd/yWCYmJ">try</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">get_name</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">names</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">vec</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Smith&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">()];</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>we&#8217;ll be served with a classic borrow checker&nbsp;error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&lt;anon&gt;:3:25: 3:33 error: cannot move out of indexed content [E0507]
&lt;anon&gt;:3     let fullname = join(names[0], names[1]);
                                 ^~~~~~~~
</pre></div>


<p>Behind its rather cryptic verbiage, it informs us that we tried to move a <em>part</em> of the <code>names</code> vector &#8212; its first
element &#8212; to a new variable (here, a function parameter). This isn&#8217;t allowed, because in principle it would
render the vector invalid from the standpoint of strict memory safety. Rust would no longer guarantee <code>names[0]</code> to be
a legal <code>String</code>: its internal pointer could&#8217;ve been invalidated by the code which the element moved to
(the <code>join</code> function)<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But while commendable, this guarantee isn&#8217;t exactly <em>useful</em> here. Even though <code>names[0]</code> would technically be invalid,
there isn&#8217;t anyone to actually notice this fact. The <code>names</code> vector is inaccessible outside of the function
it&#8217;s defined in, and even the function itself doesn&#8217;t look at it after the move. In its present form,
the program <del>is inarguably correct</del><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> could&#8217;ve been accepted if partial moves from <code>Vec</code> were allowed
by the borrow&nbsp;checker.</p>
<h4>Pointers to the&nbsp;rescue?</h4>
<p>Vectors wouldn&#8217;t be very useful or efficient, though, if we could only obtain <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html">copies</a> or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html">clones</a> of their elements.
As this is an inherent limitation of Rust&#8217;s memory model, and applies to <em>all</em> compound types
(structs, hashmaps, etc.), it&#8217;s been recognized and countermeasures are&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>However, the <a href="http://is.gd/o3GRnw">idiomatic practice</a> is to actually leave the elements be and access them
solely through&nbsp;references:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">get_name</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">names</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">vec</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Smith&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">()];</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">clone</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>The obvious downside of this approach is that it requires an interface change to <code>join</code>: it now has to accept
pointers instead of actual objects<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. And since the result is a completely new <code>String</code>, we have to either bite
the bullet and <code>clone</code>, or write a more awkward <code>join_into(a: &amp;mut String, b: &amp;String)</code> function.<br/>
In general, making an <span class="caps">API</span> switch from actual objects to references has an annoying tendency to percolate up
the call stacks and abstraction&nbsp;layers.</p>
<h4>Vector&nbsp;solution</h4>
<p>If we still insist on moving the elements out, at least in case of vector we aren&#8217;t <em>completely</em> out of luck.
The <code>Vec</code> type offers several specialized methods that can slice, dice, and splice the collection in various ways.
Those&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.split_first"><code>split_first</code></a> (and <code>split_first_mut</code>)
for cutting right after the first&nbsp;element</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.split_last"><code>split_last</code></a> (and <code>split_last_mut</code>)
for a similar cut right before the last&nbsp;element</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.split_at"><code>split_at</code></a> (and <code>split_at_mut</code>),
generalized versions of the above&nbsp;methods</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.split_off"><code>split_off</code></a>, a partially-in-place version
of <code>split_at_mut</code></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.drain"><code>drain</code></a> for moving all elements from a specified&nbsp;range</li>
</ul>
<p>Other types may offer different methods, depending on their particular data layout, though <code>drain</code> should be available
on any data structure that can be iterated&nbsp;over.</p>
<h4>Structural&nbsp;advantage</h4>
<p>What about user-defined types, such as <code>struct</code>s?</p>
<p>Fortunately, these are covered by the compiler itself. Since accessing <code>struct</code> fields is a fully compile-time
operation, it is possible to track the ownership of each individual object that makes up the structure.
Thus there are no obstacles to simply <a href="http://is.gd/ZUI2Mn">moving all the fields</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">first_name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">last_name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">get_name</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">first_name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">                   </span><span class="n">last_name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Smith&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">to_owned</span><span class="p">()};</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">first_name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">last_name</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<h4>If all else&nbsp;fails&#8230;</h4>
<p>This leaves us with some rare cases when the container&#8217;s interface doesn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> support the exact subset of elements
we want to move out. If we don&#8217;t want to <code>drain</code> them all and inspect every item for potential preservation,
it may be time to skirt around the more dangerous areas of the&nbsp;language.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t necessarily mean going all out with <code>unsafe</code> blocks, pointers, and (let&#8217;s be honest) segfaults.
Instead, we can look at the gray zone between them and the regular, borrow-checked Rust&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Some of the functions inside the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/index.html"><code>std::mem</code> module</a> can be said
to fall into this category. Most notably, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.swap.html"><code>mem::swap</code></a> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.replace.html"><code>mem::replace</code></a> allow us to operate directly on the memory blocks
that back every Rust object, albeit without the dangerous ability to freely modify&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>What those functions enable is a small sleight of hand &#8212; a quick exchange of two variables or objects
while the borrow checker &#8220;isn&#8217;t looking&#8221;. Possessing such an ability, we can smuggle any item out of a container
as long as we&#8217;re able to provide a suitable&nbsp;replacement:</p>

    </p>

  <div>
      <p>A relatively little known feature of Python is the <code>else</code> block for control flow statements other than <code>if</code>.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard about it before, you can provide such a block for both <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops,
as well as any variant of the <code>try</code> statement, Its functionality is roughly analogous in both&nbsp;cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>in loops, the <code>else</code> block is executed if the loop didn&#8217;t exit abnormally (i.e. with <code>break</code>)</li>
<li>in <code>try</code> constructs, the <code>else</code> block runs if <em>no</em> exception&nbsp;happened</li>
</ul>
<p>Likely because of the unique semantics that don&#8217;t exist in other languages, neither of those constructs has been seen much
in real world code. Recently, however, I&#8217;ve found they can be combined into a very pythonic pattern
that&#8217;s also quite&nbsp;useful.</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;trick</h4>
<p>Say you have a task that won&#8217;t always succeed. Perhaps it&#8217;s a request made to a janky server, or other network operartion
that&#8217;s prone to timeouts. Since failures are likely to be transient, you&#8217;d like to retry it several more times before
giving up&nbsp;permanently.</p>
<p>With <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> block, you can detect those half-expected failures. With a simple loop, you can repeat the attempt
for as many times as you deem feasible. Combined, they can solve the problem rather&nbsp;neatly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">MAX_RETRIES</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># ... do stuff ...</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">SomeTransientError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># ... log it, sleep, etc. ...</span>
        <span class="k">continue</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="n">PermanentError</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>But&nbsp;why?</h4>
<p>What&#8217;s the deal with the <code>else</code>s here, though? Are they both&nbsp;necessary?</p>
<p>The simple answer is of course no. <code>else</code> after either a loop or  <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> block is always a <em>syntactic sugar</em>.
Any code that contains it can be transformed into an equivalent snippet that utilizes different techniques to achieve
the same&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>But this view isn&#8217;t very useful, for many of the essential features in any programming languages can be dismissed
as superfluous using this reasoning. The real question is whether the above idiom is more readable and understandable
than the&nbsp;alternatives.</p>
<p>To that, I posit, the answer is: <em>absolutely</em>.</p>
<h4>Desugaring</h4>
<p>Without the double <code>else</code>, this example would have to be written in a considerably more convoluted&nbsp;way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">retries</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MAX_RETRIES</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">retries</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># ... do stuff ...</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">SomeTransientError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># ... log it, sleep, etc. ...</span>
        <span class="n">retries</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">retries</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="n">PermanentError</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Although at first glance the difference may be minuscule, this version adds significant extra busywork the programmer
has to pay careful attention&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>retries</code> variable now has to be explicit, because the final conditional statement must look at its&nbsp;value.</li>
<li>We can&#8217;t use a <code>for</code> loop anymore (e.g. <code>for retries in range(MAX_RETRIES)</code>), because we wouldn&#8217;t distinguish the
&#8220;success at last try&#8221; and &#8220;retry limit exceeded&#8221; cases: they&#8217;d both result in <code>retries</code> equal to <code>MAX_RETRIES - 1</code>
after the loop<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>As a result, we have to remember to decrement the counter ourselves upon an&nbsp;error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the <code>break</code> is easy to miss amidst the actual logic within the <code>try</code> block, both for developer
who writes the code and for any subsequent readers. An alternative is to move it outside of the <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> clause,
but that in turn reintroduces <code>continue</code> into the <code>except</code> branch and further complicates the whole&nbsp;flow.</p>
<p>In short, the desugared version is more error-prone (all those off-by-ones!) and also quite&nbsp;inscrutable.</p>
<div class="footnote">

<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Or to <code>1</code>, if we count from <code>MAX_RETRIES</code> down to zero.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>If you look at discussion forums for people in the <span class="caps">CS</span> industry &#8212;
like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/">/r/cscareequestions</a> or even just Hacker News &#8212;
you&#8217;ll find lots of talk about the so called <em>Big Four</em>&nbsp;companies.</p>
<p>This is mostly in the context of applying to them, or going through their interview process.
Which of the large software corporations are discussed here tends to fluctuate a little bit,
but both Google and Microsoft are invariably included, with Facebook popping up more often than&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Because of their privileged positions as very desirable places to work, these companies tend to be taken as models
for others to mimic<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Probably the most apparent and direct outcome is the increasing prevalence of
&#8220;Google-style&#8221; interviews, which are now utilized by countless software shops around the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p><em>Whiteboard coding</em> is how they are often called. It is a subject of an intense debate, whether or not they &#8220;work&#8221;,
and adequately assess the engineering aptitude of candidates. If some
<a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768">high profile anecdotes</a> are of any indication, the most common complaint
is that they fail to recognize competence by ignoring previous professional work, open source contributions,
conference talks, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Instead, the whiteboard interview requires demand showing a &#8220;pure&#8221; problem solving ability
within a relatively short time window, all without some broader context or even the usual tools of the trade:
laptop, editor, and a search&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>As a Googler who had gone through this process and has now conducted a few of those interviews himself,
I find those complaints mostly valid albeit&nbsp;misdirected.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t really that Google interviews like it&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really the issue is <em>other companies</em> implementing the same process, and not realizing it cannot possibly work for&nbsp;them.</p>
<h4>Somewhat&nbsp;special</h4>
<p>It is important to understand that Google&#8217;s stance on interviewing is influenced by some unique&nbsp;circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>very high and steady influx of potential&nbsp;candidates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comparatively long tenure of the average engineer and the general focus on employee&nbsp;retention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>huge and mostly proprietary software stack working at a scale that almost no others&nbsp;do</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From this perspective, it makes sense to utilize cautious hiring strategies that may result in a high ratio
of <em>false negatives</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. When rejections are cheap but the new hires are supposed to be here for the long run &#8212;
partially because of the long ramp-up time necessary to become productive &#8212; it can be costly to give candidates
the benefit of the&nbsp;doubt.</p>
<p>The last point also explains why proficiency with specific technologies is less useful than
general flexibility grounded in strong fundamentals. To put it shortly, Google prefers you know
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"><span class="caps">CS</span></a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, whiteboard coding is just one input to the evaluation process, but it tends to be the most trustworthy one.
Besides programming aptitude, the ideal candidate would show a proven track record of technical leadership while
tackling complex problems that span a broad scope.<br>
Unfortunately, those qualities are difficult to convey <em>efficiently</em> and <em>reliably</em> through the usual industry channels:
a resume, references from previous jobs, GitHub profile,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<h4>Different&nbsp;conditions</h4>
<p>Given the above reasoning as to why &#8220;Google-style&#8221; interviews seem to work well for Google, I hope it&#8217;s evident why
they are likely a poor choice for companies that don&#8217;t share the same characteristics as the Big&nbsp;4.</p>
<p>For one, it is highly unusual for a software shop in today&#8217;s market to command a sizeable pool for qualified candidates.
Software engineering vacancies often go unfilled for weeks and months, even if the company isn&#8217;t exactly looking
for &#8220;rockstars&#8221;, &#8220;ninjas&#8221;, &#8220;gunslingers&#8221;, or whatever the silly term <em>du jour</em> is. Those who meet the requirements
usually have their pick at many different offers,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>The reality for many companies (especially startups) is also one where they are unable or unwilling to invest much
in the retention of their employees. Because the employment relationship in this industry tends to be quite volatile
(which isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing), it often makes sense for companies to look for a near-immediate payoff
when&nbsp;hiring.</p>
<p>We owe it to the prevalent open source technologies that this isn&#8217;t entirely unreasonable. If your software stack
is composed entirely of components that are available in the open, you can probably find engineers who are familiar
with most of them. They can be productive members of your team almost literally from day&nbsp;one!</p>
<h4>Right tool for the&nbsp;job</h4>
<p>The most important observation is that every company is <em>different</em>, and following the One True Best Practice™ will likely
prevent you from utilizing the best qualities of your work place. Smaller shops, for example, could take a more personalized
approach to hiring: let candidates actually sit with engineers, solve real-life problems, and have deep technical&nbsp;conversations.</p>
<p>Of course, you may still find whiteboard coding valuable in its own right. Indeed, a simple test for at least
the basic programming skill appears to be a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">necessary sanity check</a>.</p>
<p>But a full suite of difficult technical interviews with tough algorithmic problems that last a better part of the day?
Most likely&nbsp;not.</p>

  <div>
      <p>Having recently been writing some C++ code at work, I had once again experienced the kind of exasperation that this
cumbersome language evokes on regular basis. When I was working in it less sporadically, I was shrugging it off
and telling myself it&#8217;s all because of the low level it operates on. Superior performance was the other side of the deal,
and it was supposed to make all the trade-offs&nbsp;worthwhile.</p>
<p>Now, however, I realized that running close to the metal by no means excuses the sort of clunkiness that C++ permits.
For example, there really is no reason why the archaically asinine separation of header <span class="amp">&amp;</span> source files &#8212;
with its inevitable redundancy of declarations and definitions, worked around with Java-esque contraptions such as
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PimplIdiom">pimpl</a> &#8212; is still the bread and butter of C++ programs.<br/>
Same goes for the lack of sane dependency management, or a universal, portable build system. None of those would be
at odds with native compilation to machine code, or runtime speeds that are adequate for real-time&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>Rather than dwelling on those gripes, I thought it&#8217;d be more productive to look around and see what&#8217;s
the modern offerring in the domain of lower level, <em>really</em> fast languages. The search wasn&#8217;t long at all, because
right now it seems there is just one viable contender: Rust<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Rusty&nbsp;systems</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> introduces itself as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language">&#8220;systems programming language&#8221;</a>, which is quite a bold claim.
What followed the last time this phrase has been applied to an emerging language &#8212; Go &#8212; was a kind of
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Of-the-emerging-systems-languages-Rust-D-Go-and-Nim-which-is-the-strongest-language-and-why">word twisting</a>
that&#8217;s more indicative of politics, not computer&nbsp;science.</p>
<p>But Rust&#8217;s pretense to the system level is well justified. It clearly provides the requisite toolkit for working
directly with the hardware, be it <a href="https://github.com/miselin/rustic">embedded controllers</a> or
<a href="http://www.redox-os.org/">fully featured computers</a>. It offers compilation to native machine code;
direct memory access; running time guarantees thanks to the lack of <span class="caps">GC</span>-incuded stops;
and great interoperability through static and dynamic&nbsp;linkage.</p>
<p>In short, with Rust you can wreak havoc against the <span class="caps">RAM</span> and twiddle bits to your heart&#8217;s&nbsp;content.</p>
<h4>Safe and&nbsp;sound</h4>
<p>To be fair, though, the &#8220;havoc&#8221; part is not entirely accurate. Despite its focus on the low level, efficient computing,
Rust aims to be a very safe language. Unlike C, it actively tries to prevent the programmer from shooting themselves
in the foot &#8212; though it will hand you the gun if you but ask for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The safety guarantees provided by Rust apply to resource management, with the specific emphasis on memory
and pointers to it. The way that most contemporary languages deal with memory is by introducing a <em>garbage collector</em>
which mostly (though not wholly) relieves the programmer from thinking about allocations and deallocations.
However, the kind of global, stop-the-world garbage collections
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Na.C3.AFve_mark-and-sweep">mark-and-sweep</a>)
is costly and unpredictable, ruling it out as a mechanism for real-time&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>For this reason, Rust doesn&#8217;t mandate a <span class="caps">GC</span> of this kind<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. And although it offers mechanisms that are similar to
smart pointers from C++ (e.g. <code>std::shared_ptr</code>), it is actually preferable and <em>safer</em> to use regular, &#8220;naked&#8221; pointers:
<code>&amp;Foo</code> versus <code>Cell&lt;Foo&gt;</code> or <code>RefCell&lt;Foo&gt;</code> (which are some of the Rust&#8217;s &#8220;smart pointer&#8221;&nbsp;types).</p>
<p>The trick is in the clever compiler. As long as we use regular pointers, it is capable of detecting potential memory
bugs at <em>compilation time</em>. They are referred to as &#8220;data races&#8221; in Rust&#8217;s terminology, and include
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/references-and-borrowing.html#issues-borrowing-prevents">perennial problems</a>
that will segfault any C code which wasn&#8217;t written with utmost&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>Part of those safety guarantees is also the <em>default immutability</em> of references (pointers). The simplest reference
of type <code>&amp;Foo</code> in Rust translates to something like <code>const Foo * const</code> in C<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. You have to explicitly request
mutability with the <code>mut</code> keyword, and Rust ensures there is always at most one mutable reference to any value,
thus preventing problems caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_aliasing">pointer aliasing</a>.</p>
<p>But what if you really must sling raw pointers, and access arbitrary memory locations? Maybe you are programming
a microcontroller where I/O is done through a special memory region. For those occasions, Rust has got you covered
with the <code>unsafe</code> keyword:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// Read the state of a diode in some imaginary uC.</span>
<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">get_led_state</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">isize</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>Its usage, like in the above example, can be <em>very</em> localized, limited only to those places where it&#8217;s truly necessary
and guarded by the appropriate checks. As a result, the interface exposed by the above function
can be considered safe. The unrestricted memory access can be contained to where it&#8217;s really&nbsp;inevitable.</p>
<h4>Typing&nbsp;counts</h4>
<p>Ensuring memory safety is not the only way in which Rust differentiates itself from C.
What separates those two languages is also a few decades of practice and research into programming semantics.
It&#8217;s only natural to expect Rust to take advantage of this&nbsp;progress.</p>
<p>And advantage it takes. Although Rust&#8217;s type system isn&#8217;t nearly as advanced and complex like &#8212; say &#8212; Scala&#8217;s,
it exhibits several interesting properties that are indicative of its relatively modern&nbsp;origin.</p>
<p>First, it mixes the two most popular programming paradigms &#8212; functional and object-oriented &#8212; in roughly equal
concentrations, as opposed to being biased towards the latter. Rust doesn&#8217;t have interfaces or classes: it has <em>traits</em>
and their <em>implementations</em>. Even though they often fulfill similar purposes of abstraction and encapsulation,
these constructs are closer to the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class">type classes</a>
and their instances, which are found for example in&nbsp;Haskell.</p>
<p>Still, the more familiar notions of <span class="caps">OOP</span> aren&#8217;t too far off. Most of the key functionality of classes, for example,
can be simulated by implementing &#8220;default&#8221; traits for user-defined&nbsp;types:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>The second aspect of Rust&#8217;s type system that we would come to expect from a new language is its expressive power.
<em>Type inference</em> is nowadays a staple, and above we can observe the simplest form of it. But it extends further,
to generic parameters, closure arguments, and closure return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>Generics, by the way, are quite nice as well. Besides their applicability to structs, type aliases, functions,
traits, trait implementations, etc., they allow for constraining their arguments with traits. This is similar to
the abandoned-and-not-quite-revived-yet idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_%28C%2B%2B%29">concepts in C++</a>,
or to an analogous mechanism from&nbsp;C#.</p>
<p>The third common trend in contemporary language design is the use of type system to solve common tasks.
Rust doesn&#8217;t go full Haskell and opt for monads for everything, but its <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> types are evidently
the functional approach to error handling<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. To facilitate their use, a powerful
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/patterns.html"><em>pattern matching</em> facility</a> is also present in&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<h4>Unexpectedly&nbsp;pythonic</h4>
<p>If your general go-to language is Python, you will find Rust a very nice complement and possibly a valuable instrument
in your coding arsenal. Interoperability between Python and Rust is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/rust-inside-other-languages.html#python">stupidly easy</a>,
thanks to both the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/ctypes.html"><code>ctypes</code> module</a> and the extreme simplicity
of creating portable,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/rust-inside-other-languages.html#a-rust-library">shared libraries</a> in Rust.
Offloading some expensive, <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock"><span class="caps">GIL</span></a>-bypassing computation to a fast,
native code written in Rust can thus be a relatively painless way of speeding up crucial parts of a Python&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>But somewhat more surprisingly, Rust has quite a few bits that seem to be directly inspired by Python semantics.
Granted, those two languages are conceptually pretty far apart in general, but the analogies are&nbsp;there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/iterators.html">iterators</a> in Rust is very similar to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-iterable">iterables</a> in Python. Even the <code>for</code> loop is basically identical:
rather than manually increment a counter, both in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/loops.html#for">Rust</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop">Python</a> you iterate over a <em>range of numbers</em>.<br/>
Oh, and both languages have an <code>enumerate</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/loops.html#enumerate">method</a>/
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate">function</a> that yields pairs of <code>(index, element)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/method-syntax.html#method-calls">method definition</a>
in Rust uses the <code>self</code> keyword as first argument to distinguish between instance methods and &#8220;class&#8221;/&#8221;static&#8221; methods
(or <em>associated functions</em> in Rust&#8217;s parlance).
This is even more pythonic than in actual Python, where <code>self</code> is technically just a convention,
albeit an extremely strong&nbsp;one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In either language, overloading operators doesn&#8217;t use any new keywords or special syntax,
like it does in C++, C#, and others. Python accomplishes it through <code>__magic__</code> methods, whereas Rust
has very similarly named <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/operators-and-overloading.html">operator traits</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust basically <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/documentation.html#documentation-as-tests">has <code>doctest</code></a>.
If you don&#8217;t know, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html"><code>doctest</code> module</a> is a standard Python testing
utility that can run usage examples found in documentation comments and verify their correctness. Rust version (<code>rustdoc</code>)
is even more powerful and flexible, allowing for example to mark additional boilerplate lines that should be run
when testing examples, but <em>not</em> included in the generated&nbsp;documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the list doesn&#8217;t end here and will grow over time. As of this writing, for example, nightly builds of Rust
already offer <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/slice-patterns.html">advanced slice pattern matching</a> which are
very similar to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/">extended iterable unpacking</a> from Python&nbsp;3.</p>
<h4>Is it worth&nbsp;it?</h4>
<p>Depending on your background and the programming domain you are working in, you may be wondering if Rust
is a language that&#8217;s worth looking into now, or in the near&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Firstly, let me emphasize that it&#8217;s still in its early stages. Although the stable version 1.0 has been released
<a href="http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html">a good couple of months ago</a>, the ecosystem isn&#8217;t nearly as diverse
and abundant as in some of the other new&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>If you are specifically looking to deploying Rust-written <span class="caps">API</span> servers, backends, and other &#8212; shall I use the word
&#8212; microservices, then right now you&#8217;ll probably be better served by more established solutions,
like Java with <a href="http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/">fibers</a>, asynchronous Python on PyPy, Erlang,
Go, node.js, or similar.
I predict Rust catching up here in the coming months, though, because the prospect of writing native speed <span class="caps">JSON</span> slingers
with relative ease is just too compelling to&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>The other interesting area for Rust is <em>game programming</em>, because it&#8217;s one of the few languages capable of supporting
even the most demanding <span class="caps">AAA</span>+ productions. The good news is that portable, open source
<a href="http://www.piston.rs/">game engines</a> are already here. The bad news is that most of the existing knowledge
about designing and coding high performance games is geared towards writing (stripped down) C++. The community
is also rather <del>stubborn</del> reluctant to adopt anything that may carry even a <em>hint</em> of potentially unknown
performance implications. Although some inroads have been made (here&#8217;s, for example,
an <a href="https://github.com/HeroesGrave/ecs-rs">entity component system</a> written in Rust), and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
to see indie games written in Rust, it probably won&#8217;t take over the industry anytime&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware, though, Rust may already have the upper hand. It is obviously much easier language to program in
than pure C. Along with its toolchain&#8217;s ability to produce
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/no-stdlib.html">minimal executables</a>, it makes for a compelling language for
programming microcontrollers and other embedded&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>So in short, Rust is pretty nice. And if you have read that far, I think you should just go ahead
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">have a look</a> for yourself&nbsp;:)</p>
<div class="footnote">

  <div>
      <p>Python has many <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">batteries included</a>, but a few things are still conspicuously&nbsp;missing.</p>
<p>One of them is a standardized and convenient approach to <span class="caps">URL</span> manipulation, akin to the
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URI.html"><code>URI</code> class</a> in Java.
There are some functions in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html"><code>urllib</code></a>, of course
(or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html"><code>urllib.parse</code></a> in Python 3), but much like their <span class="caps">HTTP</span>-related
comrades, they prove rather verbose and somewhat&nbsp;clunky.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HTTP</span>, however, is solved by the <a href="http://python-requests.org/">Requests</a> package, so you may wonder
if there is some analogous package for <span class="caps">URL</span> operations. The answer is affirmative, and the library in question is,
quite whimsically, called <a href="https://github.com/gruns/furl"><em>furl</em></a>.</p>
<h4><span class="caps">URL</span> in a&nbsp;wrap</h4>
<p>The sole interesting part of the <em>furl</em> interface is the <code>furl</code> class. It represents a single <span class="caps">URL</span>, broken down to
its constituents, with properties and methods for both reading them out and replacing with new&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>Thanks to this handy (and quite obvious) abstraction, common <span class="caps">URL</span> operations become quite simple and&nbsp;self-documenting:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">furl</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">furl</span>

    <span class="n">furled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">furl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">profile_url</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">furled</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;facebook.com&#39;</span> <span class="ow">or</span>

<span class="c"># etc.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This includes the extremely prevalent, yet very harmful pattern of bulding URLs through string&nbsp;interpolation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s">?</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s">&#39;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">BASE_URL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">urlencode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">query_params</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Besides looking unpythonically ugly, it&#8217;s also inflexible and error-prone. If <code>BASE_URL</code> gains some innate query string
params (<code>'http://example.com/?a=b'</code>), this method will start producing completely invalid <code>url</code>s (with two question marks,
e.g. <code>'http://example.com/?a=b?foo=bar'</code>).</p>
<p>The equivalent in <em>furl</em> has none of these&nbsp;flaws:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">furl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">BASE_URL</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">query_params</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>The full&nbsp;package</h4>
<p>To see the full power of <em>furl</em>, I recommend having a look at its
<a href="https://github.com/gruns/furl/blob/master/API.md"><span class="caps">API</span> documentation</a>. It&#8217;s quite clear and should be very easy to&nbsp;use.</p>

  <div>
      <p><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> is a JavaScript &#8220;framework&#8221; that has always lurked in the shadows of other,
more flashy ones. Even in the days of its relative novelty, the likes of Backbone or Ember had seemed to garner more
widespread interest among frontend developers. Today, this hasn&#8217;t changed much, the difference being mainly
that the spotlight is now taken by new actors (<em>*cough*</em> <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> <em>*cough*</em>).</p>
<p>But Knockout has a loyal following, and for good reasons. Possibly the most imporant one is why I&#8217;ve put the word
&#8220;framework&#8221; in quotes. Knockout is, first and foremost, a <em>data binding</em> library: it doesn&#8217;t do much else besides
tying <span class="caps">DOM</span> nodes to JavaScript&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>This quality makes it both easy to learn and simple to integrate. In fact, it can very well live in just some small
compartments of your web application, mingling easily with any server-side templating mechanism you might be using.
It also interplays effortlessly with other <span class="caps">JS</span> libraries, and sticks very well to
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/30766900/434799">whatever duct tape you use</a> to hold your frontend stack&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>Lastly, it&#8217;s also quite extensible. We can, for example, create our own
<a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-syntax.html">bindings</a> rather easily, extending the declarative language
used to describe relationship between the data and <span class="caps">UI</span>.</p>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to demonstrate this by implementing a very simple <code>let:</code> binding &#8212;
a kind of &#8220;assignment&#8221; of an expression to a&nbsp;name.</p>
<h4>From Knockout <code>with:</code> bluff</h4>
<p>Out of box, Knockout proffers the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/with-binding.html"><code>with:</code> binding</a>,
a quite similar mechanism. How it may be somewhat problematic is analogous to the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with">widely discouraged <code>with</code> statement</a>
in JavaScript itself. Namely, it blends several namespaces together, making it harder to determine which object
is being referred to. As a result, the code is more prone to&nbsp;errors.</p>
<p>On the other hand, freeing the developer from repeating long and complicated expressions is obviously valuable.
Perhaps reducing them to nil is not the right approach, though, so how about we just shorten them
to a more manageable length? Well, that&#8217;s exactly what the <code>let:</code> binding is meant to&nbsp;do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;let: { addr: currentUser.personalInfo.address }&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: addr.line1&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- ko if: addr.line2 --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: addr.line2&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- /ko --&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: add.city&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>,
    <span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: add.region&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: add.country&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Making it happen turns out to be pretty&nbsp;easy.</p>
<h4>Binding&nbsp;contract</h4>
<p>To define a Knockout binding, up to two things are needed. We have to specify what the library should&nbsp;do:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the binding is first applied to a <span class="caps">DOM</span> node (the <code>init</code> method)</li>
<li>when any of the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html">observed values</a> changes (the <code>update</code> method)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every binding has to implement both methods. In our cases, only the <code>init</code> is necessary, because all we have to do
is modify the <em>binding context</em>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that? Shortly speaking, a <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-context.html">binding context</a>,
is an object holding all the data you can potentially bind to your <span class="caps">DOM</span> nodes. Think of it as a namespace, or local scope:
whatever&#8217;s in there can be used directly inside <code>data-bind</code> attributes.</p>
<h4><code>let:</code> it&nbsp;go</h4>
<p>Therefore, all that the <code>let:</code> binding has to do is to extend the context with a mapping passed to it as an argument.
Well, almost&nbsp;all:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">ko</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bindingHandlers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;let&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">init</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">valueAccessor</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">allBindings</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">viewModel</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">bindingContext</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">innerContext</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">bindingContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">valueAccessor</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nx">ko</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">applyBindingsToDescendants</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">innerContext</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">controlsDescendantBindings</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span> <span class="p">};</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The resulting <code>innerContext</code> is a copy of the original <code>bindingContext</code>, augmented with additional properties from
the argument of <code>let:</code> (those are available through <code>valueAccessor</code>). Once we have it, though, we need to handle it
in a little special&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Normally, Knockout is processing all bindings recursively, pasing down the same <code>bindingContext</code> (which ultimately
comes from the root <code>viewModel</code>). But since we want to locally alter the context, we also need to interrupt this regular
way and take care of the lower-level <span class="caps">DOM</span> nodes&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the overly-long <code>ko.applyBindingsToDescendants</code> function is doing. The only caveat is that Knockout
has to be <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/custom-bindings-controlling-descendant-bindings.html">told explicitly</a>
about our intentions through the <code>return</code> value from <code>init</code>. Otherwise, it would try to apply the <em>original</em>
<code>bindingContext</code> recursively, which in our case would amount to applying it <strong>twice</strong>.
<code>{ controlsDescendantBindings: true }</code> prevents Knockout from doing so&nbsp;erroneously.</p>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Like I mentioned in the <a href="http://xion.io/post/code/sqlalchemy-regex-filters.html">post about adding regular expression support</a>,
the nice thing about <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> is the clean, layered structure of various abstractions
it&nbsp;utilizes.</p>
<p>Regretably, though, we know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">software abstractions tend to leak</a>.
Inn particular, any <span class="caps">ORM</span> seem to be a poster child of this rule, especially in the popular opinion among
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/search?q=ORM&amp;restrict_sr=on">developer crowds</a>.
By design, they&#8217;re intended to hide at least <em>some</em> details of the operations on a database,
but those very details can be quite critical at times. There are situations when we simply want to know
what <em>exactly</em> is going on, and how all those model classes and mappers and relationships translate
to the actual <span class="caps">SQL</span>&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>To make it a little more concrete, let&#8217;s focus on the SQLAlchemy <code>Query</code> class. Given such a query, we&#8217;d like to get
the final <span class="caps">SQL</span> representation of it, the one that&#8217;s ultimately sent to the database, It could be useful
for any number of things, from logging<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to profiling, or just displaying in the web page&#8217;s footer,
or even solely for prototyping in the Python <span class="caps">REPL</span>.</p>
<p>In other words, we want to turn&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">db_session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">some_email</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>into something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">users</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">users</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>regardless of the complexity of the query, the number of model classes it spans, or the number of relationship-related
<code>JOIN</code>s it&nbsp;involves.</p>
<h4>It&#8217;s a&nbsp;dialect</h4>
<p>There is one aspect we cannot really universalize, though. It&#8217;s the specific <em>database backend</em> that SQLAlchemy
should compile our query for. Shrugging off syntactical and semantical differences between database engines
is one thing that using an <span class="caps">ORM</span> can potentially buy us, but if we want to get down to the <span class="caps">SQL</span> level,
we need to be specific about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>In SQLAlchemy&#8217;s parlance, any specific variant of the <span class="caps">SQL</span> language is called a <em>dialect</em>. Most of the time,
you&#8217;ll be interested in the particular dialect your database of choice is using. This is easily obtainable from
the <a href="docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session">database <code>Session</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">dialect</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db_session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bind</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dialect</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The resulting
<a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/internals.html#sqlalchemy.engine.interfaces.Dialect"><code>Dialect</code> object</a>
is little more than a container for small tidbits of information, used by SQLAlchemy to handle various quirks of
the database backends it supports. For our purposes, though, it can be treated as a completely opaque&nbsp;token.</p>
<h4>Compile <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;unwrap</h4>
<p>With the <code>Dialect</code> in hand, we can invoke the query compiler to get the textual representation of our <code>Query</code>.
Or, to be more precise, the compiled version of the query&#8217;s
<a href="docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/selectable.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.Select"><code>Select</code> statement</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db_session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;foo@example.com&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">statement</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dialect</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">db_session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bind</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dialect</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">SELECT</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
<span class="n">FROM</span> <span class="n">users</span>
<span class="n">WHERE</span> <span class="n">users</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email_1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="n">s</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, even after compilation the result is still just <em>another object</em>:
the <a href="docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/internals.html#sqlalchemy.engine.interfaces.Compiled"><code>Compiled</code> one</a>.
As you can see, however, the actual <span class="caps">SQL</span> text is just its <code>__str__</code><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>ing representation, which we can <code>print</code> directly
or obtain with <code>str()</code> or <code>unicode()</code>.</p>
<h4><code>Query.to_sql</code></h4>
<p>But obviously, we don&#8217;t want to type the above incantations every time we need to take a peek at the generated <span class="caps">SQL</span>
for an <span class="caps">ORM</span> query. Probably the best solution is to extend the <code>Query</code> class so that it offers this additional
functionality under a new&nbsp;method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sqlalchemy.orm.query</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Query</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">_Query</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_Query</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Custom, enhanced SQLALchemy Query class.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">to_sql</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Return a literal SQL representation of the query.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
        <span class="n">dialect</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bind</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dialect</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">statement</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dialect</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">dialect</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This new <code>Query</code> class needs then be passed as
<a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session.params.query_cls"><code>query_cls</code> argument</a>
to the constructor of <code>Session</code>. Details may vary a little bit depending on how exactly your application is set up,
but in most cases, it should be <a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/contextual.html">easy enough to figure out</a>.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>If you&#8217;re only interested in indiscriminate logging of all queries, setting the
<a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine.params.echo"><code>echo</code> parameter</a>
in <a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine"><code>create_engine</code></a> may be sufficient.
Another alternative is to look directly at the
