    <p>Just like many other people, I was following news from the last week&#8217;s
<a href="https://build.microsoft.com/"><span class="caps">BUILD</span> conference</a> with piqued interest. The ability to run Linux userland programs
on Windows &#8212; including, of course,
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/be-very-afraid-hell-has-frozen-over-bash-is-coming-to-windows-10/">bash</a> &#8212;
is something to be excited about. If nothing else, it should dramatically improve Windows support of new programming
languages that seem to pop up all the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>There was something else, however, that I couldn&#8217;t help but notice. The reactions of tech communities to this and similar developments focused very frequently on Microsoft&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>The beloved &#8220;new Microsoft&#8221;,
as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4cqm9y/xamarin_becomes_free_and_opensource/d1kjwl8">some call it</a>,
embraces open source, supports Linux, and generally does almost a full 180 with their stance on
proprietary vs. free software. The circumstances fit this narrative rather snuggly, too: a new <span class="caps">CEO</span> makes a clean break
with the past to pivot the company in this new world ruled by mobile and&nbsp;cloud.</p>
<p>Still&#8230; <em>love</em>? Even considering how Internet comments are grotesquely exaggerated most of the time, that&#8217;s quite
a declaration. The sentiment is nowhere near isolated either. But it&#8217;s not a question whether this infatuation
has a rational merit, or whether those feelings will eventually turn out to be&nbsp;misplaced.</p>
<p>The question is: why does it exist at all? We are talking about a <em>company</em> here, a for-profit organization.
How can such a language even enter the&nbsp;picture?</p>
<p>Then I realized this is not really a new phenomenon. Quite the opposite: the broad developer community seems to
always need a company to champion its core values. Nowadays, we&#8217;re simply trying to find someone new
to carry the&nbsp;standard.</p>
<p>Why? Because we feel that our old heroes have forsaken&nbsp;us.</p>
<h4>Hall of past&nbsp;fame</h4>
<p>Take <strong>GitHub</strong> for example. Once a darling of the open source community, it&#8217;s been suffering sharp criticism
for many months now. Rightfully or not, many people aren&#8217;t exactly excited &#8212; to put it mildly &#8212; about changes to
the <a href="https://github.com/blog/2146-organizations-can-now-block-abusive-users">policy</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/blog/2039-adopting-the-open-code-of-conduct">atmosphere</a> at GitHub,
typified by the ill-fated <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/githubs-ceo-ditches-meritocracy-rug-2014-1">meritocracy rug</a>.
The widely backed and long standing <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github">plea for a few critical features</a>
has only recently stopped falling on deaf ears. And in the background, there are always concerns about GitHub simply
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10823128">becoming too big</a>, and exterting too much control over
the open source&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Nota bene</em>, the very same ecosystem it had once been lauded for&nbsp;nurturing.</p>
<p>Among the other flagship tech companies, <strong>Apple</strong> or <strong>Facebook</strong> have never garnered much good will. Sure, they are
recognized for the pure utilitarian value of hardware they produce; or convenience, broad applicability, and stability
of APIs they offer. Facebook may be scoring some additional points for trying to
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">sort out</a> the mess of frontend development, but many say it&#8217;s
<a href="https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.j740brod8">not doing anybody any favors</a>.
Neither company is easy to portray as a paragon of openness, though, and it&#8217;s probably easier to argue
<a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/apples-closed-ecosystem-threatening-derail-technological-revolution-1535944">the exact opposite</a>.</p>
<p>And then there is <strong>Google</strong>, of course<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Some time in the past few years, a palpable shift occurred in how
the company is perceived by the techie crowd. It&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint the exact pivotal moment, and the
<a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">one event that leaps to attention</a>
doesn&#8217;t seem sufficient to explain it. But the tone has been set,
allowing <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html">news</a> to be
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2yt73v/google_to_close_google_code_open_source_project/cpdb6xs">molded</a>
to fit it. Add this to the usual backdrop of complaints about the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ll864/my_horrible_google_interview_experience/">onerous</a>
interview process and general fearmongering, and the picture doesn&#8217;t look very&nbsp;bright.</p>
<h4>Shades of&nbsp;grey</h4>
<p>No similar woes seem to have been plaguing Microsoft as of late, even though their record of recent &#8220;unwholesome&#8221; deeds
isn&#8217;t exactly
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2447177/updategate-windows-10-is-resetting-default-apps-back-to-microsoft-stock">clean</a>
either. Does it mean they are indeed the most fitting candidate for a (new) enterprise ally of the hacker&nbsp;community?&#8230;</p>
<p>Or maybe we can finally recognize the whole notion as the utterly silly concept it actually is. Hard to shake though
it be, this quasi-Manicheic mentality of assigning labels of virtue or sin is, at best, a naive idealism. At worst,
it&#8217;s a peculiar kind of harmful partisanship that technologists are particularly susceptible to. You may recognize it
as something that has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">very long tradition</a> in the hacker&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a tradition worth&nbsp;keeping.</p>
