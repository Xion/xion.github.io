    <p>Strings of text seem to always be a complicated topic when it comes to programming.
This counts double for low-level languages
which expose the programmer to the full complexity of memory management and&nbsp;allocation.</p>
<p>Rust is, obviously, one of those languages.
Strings in Rust are therefore represented using two distinct types:
<code>str</code> (the string <em>slice</em>) and <code>String</code> (the owned/allocated string).
Learning <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch08-02-strings.html">how to juggle those types</a>
is something you need to do very early if you want to be productive in the&nbsp;language.</p>
<p>But even after you&#8217;ve programmed in Rust for some time,
you may still trip on some more subtle issues with string handling.
In this post, I will concentrate on just one common task:
writing a function that takes a <em>string argument</em>.
We&#8217;ll see that even there, we can encounter a fair number of&nbsp;gotchas.</p>
<h4>Just reading&nbsp;it</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a simple case:
a function which merely <em>reads</em> its string&nbsp;argument:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="kt">str</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, {}!&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you&#8217;re probably well aware,
using <code>str</code> rather than <code>String</code> is the idiomatic approach here.
Because a <code>&amp;str</code> reference is essentially an address + length,
it can point to any string wheresoever:
a <code>'static</code> literal, a heap-allocated <code>String</code>, or any portion or substring&nbsp;thereof:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;world&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">from</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Alice&quot;</span><span class="p">));</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="s">&quot;Dennis Ritchie&quot;</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mf">0.</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Contrast this with an argument of type <code>&amp;String</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, {}!&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>which mandates an actual, full-blown <code>String</code> object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">from</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Bob&quot;</span><span class="p">));</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// (the other examples won&#39;t work)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There are virtually no circumstances when you would want to do this,
as it potentially forces the caller to needlessly put the string on the heap.
Even if you anticipate all function calls to involve actual <code>String</code> objects,
the automatic <code>Deref</code> coercion from <code>&amp;String</code> to <code>&amp;str</code>
should still allow you to use the more universal, <code>str</code>-based <span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<h4>Hiding the&nbsp;reference</h4>
<p>If <em>rustc</em> can successfully turn a <code>&amp;String</code> into <code>&amp;str</code>,
then perhaps it should also be possible to simply use <code>String</code> when that&#8217;s more&nbsp;convenient?</p>
<p>In general, this kind of &#8220;reverse <code>Deref</code>&#8221; doesn&#8217;t happen in Rust
outside of method calls with <code>&amp;self</code>.
It seems, however, that it would sometimes be desirable;
one reasonable use case involves chains of iterator adapters,
most importantly <code>map</code> and <code>for_each</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">strings</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">vec</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;Alice&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">into</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;Bob&quot;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">into</span><span class="p">()];</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">strings</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">into_iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">for_each</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Since the compiler doesn&#8217;t take advantage of<code>Deref</code> coercions when inferring closure types,
their argument types have to match exactly.
As a result, we often need explicit <code>|x| foo(x)</code> closures
which suffer from poorer readability in long <code>Iterator</code> or <code>Stream</code>-based&nbsp;expressions.</p>
<p>We can make the above code work
&#8212; and also retain the ability to make calls like <code>hello("Charlie");</code> &#8212;
by using one of the built-in traits that generalize over the borrowing relationships.
The one that works best for accepting string arguments is called <code>AsRef</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hello</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">AsRef</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">str</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">N</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">println</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, {}!&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">as_ref</span><span class="p">());</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Its sole method, <code>AsRef::as_ref</code>, returns a reference to the trait&#8217;s type parameter.
In the case above, that reference will obviously be of type <code>&amp;str</code>,
which circles back to our initial example, one with a direct <code>&amp;str</code> argument.</p>
<p>The difference is, however, that <code>AsRef&lt;str&gt;</code> is implemented
<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=91f084a1ae0527f3af1cba3fca421da6&amp;version=stable">for all interesting string types</a>
&#8212; both in their owned and borrowed versions.
This obviates the need for <code>Deref</code> coercions and makes the <span class="caps">API</span> more&nbsp;convenient.</p>
<h4>Own&nbsp;it</h4>
<p>Things get a little more complicated when the string parameter is needed
for more than just reading. For storage and potential mutation,
a <code>&amp;str</code> reference is not enough: you need an actual, full-blown <code>String</code> object.</p>
<p>Now, you may think this is not a huge obstacle.
After all, it&#8217;s pretty easy to &#8220;turn&#8221; <code>&amp;str</code> into a <code>String</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Greetings</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">impl</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Greetings</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// Don&#39;t do this!</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="kt">str</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">clone</span><span class="p">());</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>But I strongly advise against this practice, at least in public APIs.
If you expose such function to your users, you are essentially tricking them
into thinking their input will only ever be read, not copied,
which has implications on both performance and memory&nbsp;usage.</p>
<p>Instead, if you need to take ownership of the resulting <code>String</code>,
it is much better to indicate this in the function signature&nbsp;directly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>This shifts the burden on creating the <code>String</code> onto the caller,
but that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing.
On their side, the added boilerplate can pretty&nbsp;minimal:</p>

  "description": "Strings of text seem to always be a complicated topic when it comes to programming. This counts double for low-level languages which expose the programmer to the full complexity of memory management and allocation. Rust is, obviously, one of those languages. Strings in Rust are therefore represented using two distinct types: str (the string slice) and String (the owned/allocated string). Learning how to juggle those types is something you need to do very early if you want to be productive in the language. But even after you’ve programmed in Rust for some time, you may still trip on some more subtle issues with string handling. In this post, I will concentrate on just one common task: writing a function that takes a string argument. We’ll see that even there, we can encounter a fair number of gotchas. Just reading it Let’s start with a simple case: a function which merely reads its string argument: fn hello(name: &str) { println!("Hello, {}!", name); } As you’re probably well aware, using str rather than String is the idiomatic approach here. Because a &str reference is essentially an address + length, it can point to any string wheresoever: a 'static literal, a heap-allocated String, or any portion or substring thereof: hello("world"); hello(&String::from("Alice")); hello(&"Dennis Ritchie"[0..6]); Contrast this with an argument of type &String: fn hello(name: &String) { println!("Hello, {}!", name); } which mandates an actual, full-blown String object: hello(&String::from("Bob")); // (the other examples won't work) There are virtually no circumstances when you would want to do this, as it potentially forces the caller to needlessly put the string on the heap. Even if you anticipate all function calls to involve actual String objects, the automatic Deref coercion from &String to &str should still allow you to use the more universal, str-based API. Hiding the reference If rustc can successfully turn a &String into &str, then perhaps it should also be possible to simply use String when that’s more convenient? In general, this kind of “reverse Deref” doesn’t happen in Rust outside of method calls with &self. It seems, however, that it would sometimes be desirable; one reasonable use case involves chains of iterator adapters, most importantly map and for_each: let strings: Vec<String> = vec!["Alice".into(), "Bob".into()]; strings.into_iter().for_each(hello); Since the compiler doesn’t take advantage ofDeref coercions when inferring closure types, their argument types have to match exactly. As a result, we often need explicit |x| foo(x) closures which suffer from poorer readability in long Iterator or Stream-based expressions. We can make the above code work — and also retain the ability to make calls like hello("Charlie"); — by using one of the built-in traits that generalize over the borrowing relationships. The one that works best for accepting string arguments is called AsRef1: fn hello<N: AsRef<str>>(name: N) { println!("Hello, {}!", name.as_ref()); } Its sole method, AsRef::as_ref, returns a reference to the trait’s type parameter. In the case above, that reference will obviously be of type &str, which circles back to our initial example, one with a direct &str argument. The difference is, however, that AsRef<str> is implemented for all interesting string types — both in their owned and borrowed versions. This obviates the need for Deref coercions and makes the API more convenient. Own it Things get a little more complicated when the string parameter is needed for more than just reading. For storage and potential mutation, a &str reference is not enough: you need an actual, full-blown String object. Now, you may think this is not a huge obstacle. After all, it’s pretty easy to “turn” &str into a String: struct Greetings { Vec<String> names, } impl Greetings { // Don't do this! pub fn hello(&mut self, name: &str) { self.names.push(name.clone()); } } But I strongly advise against this practice, at least in public APIs. If you expose such function to your users, you are essentially tricking them into thinking their input will only ever be read, not copied, which has implications on both performance and memory usage. Instead, if you need to take ownership of the resulting String, it is much better to indicate this in the function signature directly: pub fn hello(&mut self, name: String) { self.names.push(name); } This shifts the burden on creating the String onto the caller, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. On their side, the added boilerplate can pretty minimal: let mut greetings = Greetings::new(); grettings.hello(String::from("Dylan")); // uhm... greetings.hello("Eva".to_string()); // somewhat better... grettings.hello("Frank".to_owned()); // not too bad greetings.hello("Gene".into()); // good enough while clearly indicating where does the memory allocation happen. It is also idiomatically used for functions taking Path parameters, i.e. AsRef<Path>. ↩"
