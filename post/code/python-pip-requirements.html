  </header>
  <div>
    <p>In this post I&#8217;ll describe all (hopefully all!) the various ways you can specify a single dependency for a Python&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>This assumes <em>pip</em> is used for installation. The list of dependencies then goes either in <code>install_requires=</code>
parameter of the <code>setup</code> function within <em>setup.py</em>, or as a separate <em>requirements.txt</em> file. Commonly, it will actually
go in both places, with the latter being the canonical source of&nbsp;truth:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">setuptools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">setup</span>

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;requirements.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">rf</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="c"># ...</span>
        <span class="n">install_requires</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">rf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readlines</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>More details about this approach can be found in
<a href="http://xion.org.pl/2014/01/27/anathomy-of-a-python-package/">one of my previous posts</a>.</p>
<p>Here, I will concentrate on the format of a single line in <em>requirements.txt</em> that defines a dependency.
There are numerous variants that <em>pip</em> supports, and they are all described in excruciating detail in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/"><span class="caps">PEP</span> 440</a>. This post shall serve as a short reference on the most useful&nbsp;ones.</p>
<h4>Package name (and&nbsp;version)</h4>
<p>The simplest and most common option is to identify a dependency by its package&nbsp;name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy
</pre></div>


<p>This will locate it in a global index of packages, which is sometimes called a &#8220;cheese shop&#8221;. Currently,
by far the most popular package registry for Python is <a href="https://pypi.python.org">PyPI</a>, and <em>pip</em> uses it by default<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Without any further modifiers, <em>pip</em> will download and install the &#8220;current&#8221; version of the package &#8212; either the newest,
or the one designated explicitly by a maintainer. This obviously makes the dependency somewhat unpredictable,
for it can mean unintended upgrades that introduce breaking changes to your&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>To prevent this, you&#8217;d normally <em>pin</em> the dependency to an exact version<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy==0.9.10
</pre></div>


<p>Other comparison operators are also&nbsp;available:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy&gt;=0.9.10
SQLAlchemy&lt;1.0.0
</pre></div>


<p>and can even be&nbsp;combined:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SQLAlchemy&gt;=0.9,&lt;1.0.0
</pre></div>


<p>Specs like that will make <em>pip</em> find the newest version that&#8217;s within given range. Assuming your dependency follows
the <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> scheme, this will allow you to stay on top of any minor bugfixes
and improvements to an older release (0.9.x here), without the risk of accidentally upgrading to a new one (1.x)
that your code is not compatible with&nbsp;yet.</p>
<h4>Repository <span class="caps">URL</span></h4>
<p>Sometimes you want to live on the bleeding edge, though, and depend not just on the latest <em>release</em>,
but the head <em>commit</em> to the package&#8217;s repository. This makes sense especially in large systems
that are distributed among multiple repos, and where development happens in&nbsp;lockstep.</p>
<p>For those occasions, and a few others, <em>pip</em> can recognize direct repository URLs. They are in the&nbsp;format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$VCS+$PROTOCOL://$URL@$LABEL#egg=$PACKAGE
</pre></div>


<p>where the <code>$PROTOCOL</code> part can be optional if the version control system has a default there. That&#8217;s for example
the case for <code>git</code>, which is of course the most important <span class="caps">VCS</span> you&#8217;d be interested in<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git://git.example.com/somepackage#egg=somepackage
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the <code>#egg=$PACKAGE</code> part is not a part of the <code>$URL</code>, and it&#8217;s only there to give a local name for the package
distribution. This is what makes it possible to refer to it later via <em>pip</em>, if only to remove it with
<code>pip uninstall $PACKAGE</code>.
Of course, the sanest practice is to use the PyPI moniker if&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>When no <code>$LABEL</code> is given, <em>pip</em> will use the <span class="caps">HEAD</span>, trunk, tip, or the equivalent default/current revision from the repo.
Often though (at least in case of Git), you would also pick a branch, tag, or even a particular <em>commit hash</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git+https://github.com/Xion/unmatcher.git@0.1.3.1#egg=unmatcher
git+ssh://github.com/You/yourpackage.git@master#egg=yourpackage
git+https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2.git@5b498453b5898257b2287f14ef6c363799f1405a#egg=Jinja2
</pre></div>


<p>The last two options could be a good choice even with third party packages, when you don&#8217;t want to wait for a new PyPI
release to get a necessary feature or an urgent bug&nbsp;fix.</p>
<h4>Local&nbsp;filesystem</h4>
<p>Lastly, you can ask <em>pip</em> to install a package from a local directory or archive. The former option is often used
with the <code>-e</code> (<code>--editable</code>) flag for <code>pip install</code>. This installs the package in the so-called <em>development mode</em>,
allowing you to edit its source code&nbsp;in-place:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ pip install -e /home/me/Code/myotherpackage
</pre></div>


<p>You almost certainly don&#8217;t want to put this line in <em>requirements.txt</em>: you should still be pulling the other package
from PyPI. But if it&#8217;s your own one  &#8212; maybe a self-contained utility library used by your main program &#8212;
this setup will be very helpful for making changes to it, informed by your own usage of the&nbsp;package.</p>

This is what makes it possible to refer to it later via pip, if only to remove it with pip uninstall $PACKAGE. Of course, the sanest practice is to use the PyPI moniker if possible. When no $LABEL is given, pip will use the HEAD, trunk, tip, or the equivalent default/current revision from the repo. Often though (at least in case of Git), you would also pick a branch, tag, or even a particular commit hash: git+https://github.com/Xion/unmatcher.git@0.1.3.1#egg=unmatcher git+ssh://github.com/You/yourpackage.git@master#egg=yourpackage git+https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2.git@5b498453b5898257b2287f14ef6c363799f1405a#egg=Jinja2 The last two options could be a good choice even with third party packages, when you don’t want to wait for a new PyPI release to get a necessary feature or an urgent bug fix. Local filesystem Lastly, you can ask pip to install a package from a local directory or archive. The former option is often used with the -e (--editable) flag for pip install. This installs the package in the so-called development mode, allowing you to edit its source code in-place: $ pip install -e /home/me/Code/myotherpackage You almost certainly don’t want to put this line in requirements.txt: you should still be pulling the other package from PyPI. But if it’s your own one — maybe a self-contained utility library used by your main program — this setup will be very helpful for making changes to it, informed by your own usage of the package. This can be changed with --index_url flag to pip install. Running local indexes is a good practice for Python shops, especially those that rely on pip install as part of their deployment process. ↩ If the package uses semantic versioning, a possible alternative to == is ~=, which means “compatible” version. The precise meaning of this is somewhat complicated, but it roughly means that upgrades are permitted as long as nothing in the public interface changes. ↩ Other options include hg (Mercurial), svn, and bzr (Bazaar). ↩"
