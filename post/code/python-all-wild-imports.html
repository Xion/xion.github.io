  <div>
    <p>An often misunderstood piece of Python import machinery is the <code>__all__</code> attribute.
While it is completely <em>optional</em>,
it&#8217;s common to see modules with the <code>__all__</code> list populated&nbsp;explicitly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">__all__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;Foo&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c"># ...</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">bar</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c"># ...</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">baz</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c"># ...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before explaining what the real purpose of <code>__all__</code> is
(and how it relates to the titular wild imports),
let&#8217;s deconstruct some common misconceptions by highlighting what it <em>isn&#8217;t</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>__all__</code> doesn&#8217;t prevent any of the module symbols (functions, classes, etc.)
from being <em>directly</em> imported.
In our the example, the seemingly omitted <code>baz</code> function (which is not included in <code>__all__</code>),
is still <em>perfectly importable</em> by writing <code>from module import baz</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, <code>__all__</code> doesn&#8217;t influence what symbols are included in the results of
<code>dir(module)</code> or <code>vars(module)</code>. So in the case above, a <code>dir</code> call would result in a
<code>['Foo', 'bar', 'baz']</code> list, even though <code>'baz'</code> does not occur in <code>__all__</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the content of <code>__all__</code> is more of a convention
rather than a strict limitation.
Regardless of what you put there, every symbol defined in your module
will still be accessible from the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>This is a clear reflection of the common policy in Python:
assume <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2003-October/025932.html">everyone is a consenting adult</a>,
and that visibility controls are not necessary.
Without an explicit <code>__all__</code> list,
Python simply puts all of the module &#8220;public&#8221; symbols there anyway<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>The meaning of it <code>__all__</code></h4>
<p>So, what does <code>__all__</code> actually&nbsp;effect?</p>
<p>This is neatly summed up in this brief
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2187636/434799">StackOverflow answer</a>.
Simply speaking, its purpose is&nbsp;twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It tells the readers of the source code &#8212; be it humans or automated tools &#8212;
what&#8217;s the conventional <em>public <span class="caps">API</span></em> exposed by the&nbsp;module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It lists names to import when performing the so-called <em>wild import</em>:
<code>from module import *</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the default content of <code>__all__</code> that I mentioned earlier,
the public <span class="caps">API</span> of a module can also be defined implicitly.
Some style guides (like the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Google one</a>)
are therefore relying on the <code>public</code> and <code>_private</code> naming exclusively.
Nevertheless, an explicit <code>__all__</code> list is still a perfectly valid option,
especially considering that no approach offers any form of <em>actual</em> access&nbsp;control.</p>
<h4>Import&nbsp;star</h4>
<p>The second point, however, has some real runtime&nbsp;significance.</p>
<p>In Python, like in many other languages,
it is recommended to be explicit about the exact functions and classes we&#8217;re importing.
Commonly, the <code>import</code> statement will thus take one of the following&nbsp;forms:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">random</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">urllib.parse</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">random</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">randint</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">logging</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">fatal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">warning</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">warn</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">urllib.parse</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">urlparse</span>
<span class="c"># etc.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In each case, it&#8217;s easy to see the relevant <em>name</em> being imported.
Regardless of the exact syntax and the possible presence of aliasing (<code>as</code>),
it&#8217;s always the last (qualified) name in the <code>import</code> statement,
before a newline or&nbsp;comma.</p>
<p>Contrast this with an <code>import</code> that ends with an&nbsp;asterisk:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">itertools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is called a <em>star</em> or <em>wild import</em>, and it isn&#8217;t so straightforward.
This is also the reason why using it is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3615206/434799">generally discouraged</a>,
except for some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3615238/434799">very specific situations</a>.</p>
<p>Why? Because you cannot easily see what exact names are being imported here.
For that you&#8217;d have to go to the module&#8217;s source and &#8212; you guessed it &#8212;
look at the <code>__all__</code> list<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Taming the&nbsp;wild</h4>
<p>Barring some less important details,
the mechanics of <code>import *</code> could therefore be expressed in the following Python&nbsp;(pseudo)code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">module</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">__temp</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">__name</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">module</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nb">globals</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">getattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__temp</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">__name</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">__temp</span>
<span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">__name</span>
</pre></div>


<p>One interesting case to consider is
what happens when <code>__all__</code> contains a <em>wrong</em>&nbsp;name.</p>
<p>What if one of the strings there doesn&#8217;t correspond to any name within the&nbsp;module?&#8230;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># foo.py</span>
<span class="n">__all__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;Foo&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">bar</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">foo</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">foo</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>
<span class="n">Traceback</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">most</span> <span class="n">recent</span> <span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">File</span> <span class="s">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="ne">AttributeError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;module&#39;</span> <span class="nb">object</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="n">no</span> <span class="n">attribute</span> <span class="s">&#39;Foo&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Quite predictably, <code>import *</code> blows up.<br>
Notice, however, that regular import <em>still works</em>.<br></p>
<p>All in all (ahem), this hints at a cute little trick which is also very&nbsp;self-evident:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">__all__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;DO_NOT_WILD_IMPORT&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Put this in a Python module, and no one will be able to <code>import *</code> from it!<br>
Much more effective than any lint warning ;-)<br></p>
<h4>Test <code>__all__</code> the&nbsp;things</h4>
<p>Jokes aside, this phenomenon (<code>__all__</code> with an out-of-place name in it) can also backfire.
Especially when
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/callee/blob/277add8170bd0c758f3c4a3068127e8229d2e2d1/callee/__init__.py#L31">reexporting</a>,
it&#8217;s relatively easy to introduce stray <code>'name'</code> into <code>__all__</code>:
one which doesn&#8217;t correspond to any <code>name</code> that&#8217;s <em>actually present</em> in the&nbsp;namespace.</p>
<p>If we commit such a mishap, we are inadvertently lying about the public <span class="caps">API</span> of our package.
What&#8217;s worse is that this mistake can propagate through documentation generators,
and ultimately mislead our&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>While some linters may be able to catch this,
a <a href="https://github.com/Xion/callee/blob/277add8170bd0c758f3c4a3068127e8229d2e2d1/tests/test_all.py#L10">simple test</a>
like this&nbsp;one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Test that __all__ contains only names that are actually exported.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">yourpackage</span>

    <span class="n">missing</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">yourpackage</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__all__</span>
                  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">getattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">yourpackage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEmpty</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">missing</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">msg</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;__all__ contains unresolved names: </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="s">&quot;, &quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">missing</span><span class="p">),))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>is a quick <span class="amp">&amp;</span> easy way to ensure this never&nbsp;happens.</p>

  "description": "An often misunderstood piece of Python import machinery is the __all__ attribute. While it is completely optional, it’s common to see modules with the __all__ list populated explicitly: __all__ = ['Foo', 'bar'] class Foo(object): # ... def bar(): # ... def baz(): # ... Before explaining what the real purpose of __all__ is (and how it relates to the titular wild imports), let’s deconstruct some common misconceptions by highlighting what it isn’t: __all__ doesn’t prevent any of the module symbols (functions, classes, etc.) from being directly imported. In our the example, the seemingly omitted baz function (which is not included in __all__), is still perfectly importable by writing from module import baz. Similarly, __all__ doesn’t influence what symbols are included in the results of dir(module) or vars(module). So in the case above, a dir call would result in a ['Foo', 'bar', 'baz'] list, even though 'baz' does not occur in __all__. In other words, the content of __all__ is more of a convention rather than a strict limitation. Regardless of what you put there, every symbol defined in your module will still be accessible from the outside. This is a clear reflection of the common policy in Python: assume everyone is a consenting adult, and that visibility controls are not necessary. Without an explicit __all__ list, Python simply puts all of the module “public” symbols there anyway1. The meaning of it __all__ So, what does __all__ actually effect? This is neatly summed up in this brief StackOverflow answer. Simply speaking, its purpose is twofold: It tells the readers of the source code — be it humans or automated tools — what’s the conventional public API exposed by the module. It lists names to import when performing the so-called wild import: from module import *. Because of the default content of __all__ that I mentioned earlier, the public API of a module can also be defined implicitly. Some style guides (like the Google one) are therefore relying on the public and _private naming exclusively. Nevertheless, an explicit __all__ list is still a perfectly valid option, especially considering that no approach offers any form of actual access control. Import star The second point, however, has some real runtime significance. In Python, like in many other languages, it is recommended to be explicit about the exact functions and classes we’re importing. Commonly, the import statement will thus take one of the following forms: import random import urllib.parse from random import randint from logging import fatal, warning as warn from urllib.parse import urlparse # etc. In each case, it’s easy to see the relevant name being imported. Regardless of the exact syntax and the possible presence of aliasing (as), it’s always the last (qualified) name in the import statement, before a newline or comma. Contrast this with an import that ends with an asterisk: from itertools import * This is called a star or wild import, and it isn’t so straightforward. This is also the reason why using it is generally discouraged, except for some very specific situations. Why? Because you cannot easily see what exact names are being imported here. For that you’d have to go to the module’s source and — you guessed it — look at the __all__ list2. Taming the wild Barring some less important details, the mechanics of import * could therefore be expressed in the following Python (pseudo)code: import module as __temp for __name in module: globals()[name] = getattr(__temp, __name) del __temp del __name One interesting case to consider is what happens when __all__ contains a wrong name. What if one of the strings there doesn’t correspond to any name within the module?… # foo.py __all__ = ['Foo'] def bar(): pass >>> import foo >>> from foo import * Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Foo' Quite predictably, import * blows up. Notice, however, that regular import still works. All in all (ahem), this hints at a cute little trick which is also very self-evident: __all__ = ['DO_NOT_WILD_IMPORT'] Put this in a Python module, and no one will be able to import * from it! Much more effective than any lint warning ;-) Test __all__ the things Jokes aside, this phenomenon (__all__ with an out-of-place name in it) can also backfire. Especially when reexporting, it’s relatively easy to introduce stray 'name' into __all__: one which doesn’t correspond to any name that’s actually present in the namespace. If we commit such a mishap, we are inadvertently lying about the public API of our package. What’s worse is that this mistake can propagate through documentation generators, and ultimately mislead our users. While some linters may be able to catch this, a simple test like this one: def test_all(self): """Test that __all__ contains only names that are actually exported.""" import yourpackage missing = set(n for n in yourpackage.__all__ if getattr(yourpackage, n, None) is None) self.assertEmpty( missing, msg="__all__ contains unresolved names: %s" % ( ", ".join(missing),)) is a quick & easy way to ensure this never happens. “Public” symbols have names that don’t begin with underscore (_). Of course, “non-public” ones are still accessible but are treated as implicitly unstable & discouraged. ↩ Or check what symbols there don’t have a leading underscore. ↩"
