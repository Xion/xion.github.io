My stance has changed somewhat since then, and I now think there is some non-trivial value that enums can add to Python code. It becomes especially apparent in the circumstances involving any kind of persistence, from pickling to databases. I will elaborate on that through the rest of this post. Revision First, let’s recap (or perhaps introduce) the important facts about enums in Python. An enum, or an enumeration type, is a special class that inherits from enum.Enum1 and defines one or more constants: from enum import Enum class Cutlery(Enum): knife = 'knife' fork = 'fork' spoon = 'spoon' Their values are then converted into singleton objects with distinct identity. They available as attributes of the enumeration type: >>> Cutlery.fork <Cutlery.fork: 'fork'> As a shorthand for when the values themselves are not important, the Enum class can be directly invoked with constant names as strings: Cutlery = Enum('Cutlery', ['knife', 'fork', 'spoon']) Resulting class offers some useful API that we’d expect from an enumeration type in any programming language: >>> list(Cutlery) [<Cutlery.knife: 'knife'>, <Cutlery.fork: 'fork'>, <Cutlery.spoon: 'spoon'>] >>> [c.value for c in Cutlery] ['knife', 'fork', 'spoon'] >> Cutlery.knife in Cutlery True >>> Cutlery('spoon') <Cutlery.spoon: 'spoon'> >>> Cutlery('spork') Traceback (most recent call last): # (...) ValueError: 'spork' is not a valid Cutlery How it was done previously Of course, there is nothing really groundbreaking about assigning some values to “constants”. It’s been done like that since times immemorial, and quite often those constants have been grouped within finite sets. Here’s an example of a comment model in some imaginary ORM, complete with a status “enumeration”: class Comment(Model): APPROVED = 'approved' REJECTED = 'rejected' IN_REVIEW = 'in_review' STATES = frozenset([APPROVED, REJECTED, IN_REVIEW]) author = StringProperty() text = TextProperty() state = String(choices=STATES) # usage comment = Comment(author="Xion", text="Boo") comment.state = Comment.IN_REVIEW comment.save() Converting it to use an Enum is relatively straightforward: class Comment(Model): class State(Enum): approved = 'approved' rejected = 'rejected' in_review = 'in_review' author = StringProperty() text = TextProperty() state = StringProperty(choices=[s.value for s in State]) comment = Comment(author="Xion", text="Meh.") comment.state = Comment.State.approved.value comment.save() It is not apparent, though, if there is any immediate benefit of doing so. True, we no longer need to define the STATES set explicitly, but saving on this bit of boilerplate is balanced out by having to access the enum’s value when assigning it to a string property. All in all, it seems like a wash — though at least we’ve established that enums are no worse than their alternatives :) Enums are interoperable Obviously, this doesn’t exactly sound like high praise. Thing is, we haven’t really replaced the previous solution completely. Remnants of it still linger in the way the state property is declared. Even though it’s supposed to hold enum constants, it is defined as string, which at this point is more of an implementation detail of how those constants are serialized. What were really need here is a kind of EnumProperty that’d allow us to work solely with enum objects. Before the introduction of a standard Enum base, however, there was little incentive for ORMs and other similiar libraries to provide such a functionality. But now, it makes much more sense to support enums as first-class citizens, at least for data exchange and serialization, because users can be expected to already prefer the standard Enum in their own code. Thus, the previous example changes into something along these lines: class Comment(Model): # ... state = EnumProperty(State) comment = Comment(author="Xion", text="Yay!") comment.state = Comment.State.approved # no .value! comment.save() Details of EnumProperty, or some equivalent construct, are of course specific to any given data management library. In SQLAlchemy, for example, a custom column type can handle the necessary serialization and deserialization between Python code and SQL queries, allowing you to define your models like this2: class Comment(Model): class State(Enum): # ... author = Column(String(255)) text = Column(Text) state = Column(EnumType(State, impl=String(32))) # usage like above In any case, the point is to have Python code operate solely on enum objects, while the persistence layer takes care of converting between them and their serializable values. Enums are extensible The other advantage Enums have over loose collections of constants is that they are proper types. Like all user-defined types in Python, they can have additional methods and properties defined on their instances, or even on the type itself. Although this capability is (by default) not as powerful as e.g. in Java — where each enum constant can override a method in its own way — it can nevertheless be quite convenient at times. Typical use cases include constant classification: class Direction(Enum): left = 37 up = 38 right = 39 down = 40 @property def is_horizontal(self): return self in (Direction.left, Direction.right) @property def is_vertical(self): return self in (Direction.down, Direction.up) and conversion: def as_vector(self): return { Direction.left: (-1, 0), Direction.up: (0, -1), Direction.right: (1, 0), Direction.down: (0, 1), }.get(self) For the latter, it would be handy to have the Java’s ability to attach additional data to an enum constant. As it turns out, Python supports this feature natively in a very similar way. We simply have to override enum’s __new__ method to parse out any extra values from the initializer and turn them into attributes of the enum instance: class Direction(Enum): left = 37, (-1, 0) up = 38, (0, -1) right = 39, (1, 0) down = 40, (0, 1) def __new__(cls, keycode, vector): obj = object.__new__(cls) obj._value_ = keycode obj.vector = vector return obj It’s possible, in fact, to insert any arbitrary computation here that yields the final _value_ of an enum constant3. This trick can be used to, for example, construct enums that automatically number themselves. Finally, we can add static methods, class methods, or class properties to the Enum subclass, just like we would do with any other class: class MyEnum(Enum): # ... @classproperty def __values__(cls): return [m.value for m in cls] Enums just are All these things are possible primarly because of the most notable aspect of Python enums: their existence as an explicit concept. A syntactically unorganized bunch of constants cannot offer half of the highlighted features because there is nowhere to pin them on. For that reason alone, using enums as an explicit — rather than implicit — pattern seems worthwhile. The one benefit we’re certain to reap is better code structure through separation of important concepts. The enum module is part of the Python standard library since version 3.4 but a fully functional backport is available for Python 2.x as well. ↩ It is even possible to instruct SQLAlchemy how to map Python enums to ENUM types in database engines that support it, but details are outside of the scope of this article. ↩ If you’re fine with the enum’s value being the whole tuple (everything after the = sign), you can override __init__ instead of __new__ (cf. the planet example from standard docs). ↩" />

    <p>Posted on Sun 25 October 2015 in <a href="http://xion.io/category/code.html">Code</a></p>

  <div>
    <p>Little over two years ago, I was writing about
<a href="http://xion.org.pl/2013/05/13/we-dont-need-no-enums-in-python/">my skepticism</a> towards the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0435/">addition of enum types to Python</a>. My stance has changed somewhat since then,
and I now think there is some non-trivial value that enums can add to Python code. It becomes especially apparent
in the circumstances involving any kind of persistence,
from <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html">pickling</a> to&nbsp;databases.</p>
<p>I will elaborate on that through the rest of this&nbsp;post.</p>
<h4>Revision</h4>
<p>First, let&#8217;s recap (or perhaps introduce) the important facts about enums in Python. An <em>enum</em>, or an enumeration type,
is a special class that inherits from <code>enum.Enum</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and defines one or more&nbsp;constants:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">enum</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Enum</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Cutlery</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">knife</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;knife&#39;</span>
    <span class="n">fork</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;fork&#39;</span>
    <span class="n">spoon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;spoon&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Their values are then converted into singleton objects with distinct identity.
They available as attributes of the enumeration&nbsp;type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">Cutlery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fork</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Cutlery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fork</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;fork&#39;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As a shorthand for when the values themselves are not important, the <code>Enum</code> class can be directly invoked
with constant names as&nbsp;strings:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Cutlery</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Cutlery&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;knife&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;fork&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;spoon&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Resulting class offers some useful <span class="caps">API</span> that we&#8217;d expect from an enumeration type in any programming&nbsp;language:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Cutlery</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Cutlery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">knife</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;knife&#39;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Cutlery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fork</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;fork&#39;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Cutlery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">spoon</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;spoon&#39;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">Cutlery</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;knife&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;fork&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;spoon&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

</pre></div>


<h4>How it was done&nbsp;previously</h4>
<p>Of course, there is nothing really groundbreaking about assigning some values to &#8220;constants&#8221;. It&#8217;s been done like that
since times immemorial, and quite often those constants have been grouped within finite&nbsp;sets.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a comment model in some imaginary <span class="caps">ORM</span>, complete with a status&nbsp;&#8220;enumeration&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Comment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">APPROVED</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;approved&#39;</span>
    <span class="n">REJECTED</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;rejected&#39;</span>
    <span class="n">IN_REVIEW</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;in_review&#39;</span>

    <span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">TextProperty</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c"># usage</span>
<span class="n">comment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Comment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">author</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;Xion&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;Boo&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Converting it to use an <code>Enum</code> is relatively&nbsp;straightforward:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Comment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">State</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">approved</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;approved&#39;</span>
        <span class="n">rejected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;rejected&#39;</span>

<p>It is not apparent, though, if there is any immediate benefit of doing so. True, we no longer need to define the <code>STATES</code>
set explicitly, but saving on this bit of boilerplate is balanced out by having to access the enum&#8217;s <code>value</code>
when assigning it to a string&nbsp;property.</p>
<p>All in all, it seems like a wash &#8212; though at least we&#8217;ve established that enums are <em>no worse</em> than their alternatives&nbsp;:)</p>
<h4>Enums are&nbsp;interoperable</h4>
<p>Obviously, this doesn&#8217;t exactly sound like high praise. Thing is, we haven&#8217;t really replaced the previous solution
<em>completely</em>. Remnants of it still linger in the way the <code>state</code> property is declared. Even though it&#8217;s supposed to hold
enum constants, it is defined as string, which at this point is more of an implementation detail of how those constants
are&nbsp;serialized.</p>
<p>What were really need here is a kind of <code>EnumProperty</code> that&#8217;d allow us to work solely with enum objects.
Before the introduction of a standard <code>Enum</code> base, however, there was little incentive for ORMs and other similiar
libraries to provide such a functionality. But now, it makes much more sense to support enums as first-class citizens,
at least for data exchange and serialization, because users can be expected to already prefer the standard <code>Enum</code>
in their own&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Thus, the previous example changes into something along these&nbsp;lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Comment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>

<span class="n">comment</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Details of <code>EnumProperty</code>, or some equivalent construct, are of course specific to any given data management library.
In SQLAlchemy, for example, a <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/5564b907e5f4e883511c">custom column type</a>
can handle the necessary serialization and deserialization between Python code and <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries,
allowing you to define your models like this<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Comment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">State</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="c"># ...</span>

<span class="c"># usage like above</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In any case, the point is to have Python code operate solely on enum objects, while the persistence layer takes
care of converting between them and their serializable&nbsp;values.</p>
<h4>Enums are&nbsp;extensible</h4>
<p>The other advantage <code>Enum</code>s have over loose collections of constants is that they are proper <em>types</em>.
Like all user-defined types in Python, they can have additional methods and properties defined on their instances,
or even on the type&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>Although this capability is (by default) not as powerful as e.g. in Java &#8212; where <em>each enum constant</em> can
<a href="https://gist.github.com/chandrasekhar4u/431839b9eac715c08b71">override a method in its own way</a> &#8212; it can nevertheless
be quite convenient at times. Typical use cases include constant&nbsp;classification:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Direction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>For the latter, it would be handy to have the Java&#8217;s ability to
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html">attach additional data</a> to an enum constant.
As it turns out, Python supports this feature natively in a very similar way.
We simply have to override enum&#8217;s <code>__new__</code> method to parse out any extra values from the initializer
and turn them into attributes of the enum&nbsp;instance:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Direction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">left</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">37</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">obj</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It&#8217;s possible, in fact, to insert any arbitrary computation here that yields the final <code>_value_</code> of an enum constant<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.
This trick can be used to, for example, construct enums that
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#autonumber">automatically number themselves</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can add static methods, class methods, or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3203659">class properties</a> to the
<code>Enum</code> subclass, just like we would do with any other&nbsp;class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyEnum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Enum</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c"># ...</span>

    <span class="nd">@classproperty</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__values__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cls</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">cls</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Enums just&nbsp;are</h4>
<p>All these things are possible primarly because of the most notable aspect of Python enums: their existence
as an <em>explicit concept</em>. A syntactically unorganized bunch of constants cannot offer half of the highlighted features
because there is nowhere to pin them&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>For that reason alone, using enums as an explicit &#8212; rather than implicit &#8212; pattern seems worthwhile.
The one benefit we&#8217;re certain to reap is better code structure through separation of important&nbsp;concepts.</p>

  "description": "Little over two years ago, I was writing about my skepticism towards the addition of enum types to Python. My stance has changed somewhat since then, and I now think there is some non-trivial value that enums can add to Python code. It becomes especially apparent in the circumstances involving any kind of persistence, from pickling to databases. I will elaborate on that through the rest of this post. Revision First, let’s recap (or perhaps introduce) the important facts about enums in Python. An enum, or an enumeration type, is a special class that inherits from enum.Enum1 and defines one or more constants: from enum import Enum class Cutlery(Enum): knife = 'knife' fork = 'fork' spoon = 'spoon' Their values are then converted into singleton objects with distinct identity. They available as attributes of the enumeration type: >>> Cutlery.fork <Cutlery.fork: 'fork'> As a shorthand for when the values themselves are not important, the Enum class can be directly invoked with constant names as strings: Cutlery = Enum('Cutlery', ['knife', 'fork', 'spoon']) Resulting class offers some useful API that we’d expect from an enumeration type in any programming language: >>> list(Cutlery) [<Cutlery.knife: 'knife'>, <Cutlery.fork: 'fork'>, <Cutlery.spoon: 'spoon'>] >>> [c.value for c in Cutlery] ['knife', 'fork', 'spoon'] >> Cutlery.knife in Cutlery True >>> Cutlery('spoon') <Cutlery.spoon: 'spoon'> >>> Cutlery('spork') Traceback (most recent call last): # (...) ValueError: 'spork' is not a valid Cutlery How it was done previously Of course, there is nothing really groundbreaking about assigning some values to “constants”. It’s been done like that since times immemorial, and quite often those constants have been grouped within finite sets. Here’s an example of a comment model in some imaginary ORM, complete with a status “enumeration”: class Comment(Model): APPROVED = 'approved' REJECTED = 'rejected' IN_REVIEW = 'in_review' STATES = frozenset([APPROVED, REJECTED, IN_REVIEW]) author = StringProperty() text = TextProperty() state = String(choices=STATES) # usage comment = Comment(author="Xion", text="Boo") comment.state = Comment.IN_REVIEW comment.save() Converting it to use an Enum is relatively straightforward: class Comment(Model): class State(Enum): approved = 'approved' rejected = 'rejected' in_review = 'in_review' author = StringProperty() text = TextProperty() state = StringProperty(choices=[s.value for s in State]) comment = Comment(author="Xion", text="Meh.") comment.state = Comment.State.approved.value comment.save() It is not apparent, though, if there is any immediate benefit of doing so. True, we no longer need to define the STATES set explicitly, but saving on this bit of boilerplate is balanced out by having to access the enum’s value when assigning it to a string property. All in all, it seems like a wash — though at least we’ve established that enums are no worse than their alternatives :) Enums are interoperable Obviously, this doesn’t exactly sound like high praise. Thing is, we haven’t really replaced the previous solution completely. Remnants of it still linger in the way the state property is declared. Even though it’s supposed to hold enum constants, it is defined as string, which at this point is more of an implementation detail of how those constants are serialized. What were really need here is a kind of EnumProperty that’d allow us to work solely with enum objects. Before the introduction of a standard Enum base, however, there was little incentive for ORMs and other similiar libraries to provide such a functionality. But now, it makes much more sense to support enums as first-class citizens, at least for data exchange and serialization, because users can be expected to already prefer the standard Enum in their own code. Thus, the previous example changes into something along these lines: class Comment(Model): # ... state = EnumProperty(State) comment = Comment(author="Xion", text="Yay!") comment.state = Comment.State.approved # no .value! comment.save() Details of EnumProperty, or some equivalent construct, are of course specific to any given data management library. In SQLAlchemy, for example, a custom column type can handle the necessary serialization and deserialization between Python code and SQL queries, allowing you to define your models like this2: class Comment(Model): class State(Enum): # ... author = Column(String(255)) text = Column(Text) state = Column(EnumType(State, impl=String(32))) # usage like above In any case, the point is to have Python code operate solely on enum objects, while the persistence layer takes care of converting between them and their serializable values. Enums are extensible The other advantage Enums have over loose collections of constants is that they are proper types. Like all user-defined types in Python, they can have additional methods and properties defined on their instances, or even on the type itself. Although this capability is (by default) not as powerful as e.g. in Java — where each enum constant can override a method in its own way — it can nevertheless be quite convenient at times. Typical use cases include constant classification: class Direction(Enum): left = 37 up = 38 right = 39 down = 40 @property def is_horizontal(self): return self in (Direction.left, Direction.right) @property def is_vertical(self): return self in (Direction.down, Direction.up) and conversion: def as_vector(self): return { Direction.left: (-1, 0), Direction.up: (0, -1), Direction.right: (1, 0), Direction.down: (0, 1), }.get(self) For the latter, it would be handy to have the Java’s ability to attach additional data to an enum constant. As it turns out, Python supports this feature natively in a very similar way. We simply have to override enum’s __new__ method to parse out any extra values from the initializer and turn them into attributes of the enum instance: class Direction(Enum): left = 37, (-1, 0) up = 38, (0, -1) right = 39, (1, 0) down = 40, (0, 1) def __new__(cls, keycode, vector): obj = object.__new__(cls) obj._value_ = keycode obj.vector = vector return obj It’s possible, in fact, to insert any arbitrary computation here that yields the final _value_ of an enum constant3. This trick can be used to, for example, construct enums that automatically number themselves. Finally, we can add static methods, class methods, or class properties to the Enum subclass, just like we would do with any other class: class MyEnum(Enum): # ... @classproperty def __values__(cls): return [m.value for m in cls] Enums just are All these things are possible primarly because of the most notable aspect of Python enums: their existence as an explicit concept.
