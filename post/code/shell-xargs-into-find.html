Assuming you’re a person who mostly prefers the terminal over some fancy GUI, you’ve probably used the find command along with xargs at least a few times. It’s very common, for example, to use the results of find as arguments to some other program.

Like a few other Unix commands, find is very particular about the order of arguments it receives.

Enter the -I flag to xargs: $ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39; This flag will tell xargs quite a few things. The most important one is to stop putting the arguments at the end of the command invocation. Instead, it shall place them wherever it sees the replacement string — here, pair of braces3: {}. And because we placed the braces where find is normally expecting the list of directories to search through, the command will now get us exactly the results we wanted. What’s almost impossible to see, however, is that it may not use the exact way we intended to obtain those results. The difference is easier to spot when we replace find with echo: $ cat &gt;/tmp/list foo bar $ cat /tmp/list | xargs echo foo bar $ cat /tmp/list | xargs -I{} echo {} foo bar or, better yet, use xargs with the -t flag to print the commands on stderr before executing them: $ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} -t find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39; &gt;/dev/null find callee -name &#39;__init__.py&#39; find tests -name &#39;__init__.py&#39; As you can see, we actually have more than one find invocation here! This is the second effect of -I: it causes xargs to execute given command line for each argument separately. It so happens that it doesn’t really make any difference for our usage of find, which is why it wasn’t at all obvious we were running it multiple times.

    <p>Posted on Sun 03 April 2016 in <a href="http://xion.io/category/code.html">Code</a></p>
  </header>
  <div>
    <p>Here&#8217;s a trick that&#8217;s hardly new, but if you haven&#8217;t heard about, it will save you a trip to a man page or&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;re a person who mostly prefers the terminal over some fancy <span class="caps">GUI</span>, you&#8217;ve probably used the <code>find</code> command
along with <code>xargs</code> at least a few times. It&#8217;s very common, for example, to use the results of <code>find</code> as arguments
to some other program. It could something as simple as figuring out which modules in your project have grown
slightly too&nbsp;large:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ find . -name &#39;*.py&#39; | xargs wc -l | sort -hr
1467 total
 322 callee/base.py
 261 callee/general.py
 251 callee/collections.py
# etc.
</pre></div>


<p>We find them all first, and then use <code>xargs</code> to build a long <code>wc</code> invocation, and we finally display results
in the reverse order. Pretty easy stuff: I don&#8217;t usually have to try more than a dozen times to get it right!<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But how about the opposite situation? Let&#8217;s say you have a list of <em>directories</em> you want to search through with <code>find</code>.
Doing so may seem easy enough<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs find -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>Except it&#8217;s not going to work. Like a few other Unix commands, <code>find</code> is very particular about the order of arguments
it receives. Not only are the predicate flags (like <code>-name</code>) considered in sequence, but they also have to appear
<em>after</em> the directories we want to search&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>But in the <code>xargs</code> invocation above, essentially the opposite is going to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<h4>The replacement&nbsp;flag</h4>
<p>So how to remedy this? Enter the <code>-I</code> flag to <code>xargs</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>This flag will tell <code>xargs</code> quite a few&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>The most important one is to stop putting the arguments at the end of the command invocation.
Instead, it shall place them wherever it sees the <em>replacement string</em> &#8212; here, pair of braces<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: <code>{}</code>.
And because we placed the braces where <code>find</code> is normally expecting the list of directories to search through,
the command will now get us exactly the results we&nbsp;wanted.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s almost impossible to see, however, is that it may not use the exact <em>way</em> we intended to obtain those results.
The difference is easier to spot when we replace <code>find</code> with <code>echo</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat &gt;/tmp/list
foo
bar
$ cat /tmp/list | xargs echo
foo bar
$ cat /tmp/list | xargs -I{} echo {}
foo
bar
</pre></div>


<p>or, better yet, use <code>xargs</code> with the <code>-t</code> flag to print the commands on stderr before executing&nbsp;them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} -t find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39; &gt;/dev/null
find callee -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
find tests -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, we actually have more than one <code>find</code> invocation&nbsp;here!</p>
<p>This is the second effect of <code>-I</code>: it causes <code>xargs</code> to execute given command line <em>for each argument separately</em>.
It so happens that it doesn&#8217;t really make any difference for our usage of <code>find</code>, which is why it wasn&#8217;t at all obvious
we were running it multiple&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>To avoid problems, though, you should definitely be cognizant of this fact when calling other programs with <code>xargs -I</code>.</p>
<h4>Make arguments spaced&nbsp;again</h4>
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;m not aware of any method that&#8217;d actually make <code>xargs</code> produce <code>find foo bar -name ...</code> calls.
If you need this exact form, probably the easiest way is to use plain old shell&nbsp;variables:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find $d -name &#39;*.py&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>This takes advantage of the <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting">word splitting</a> feature of Bash and a few other
compatible shells. Caveat is, you may be using a shell where this behavior is disabled by default. The result would be
making <code>find</code> interpret the content of <code>$d</code> as a <em>single</em> directory name: <code>foo bar</code> rather than <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>.</p>
<p>zsh is one such shell. Although <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq03.html#l18">probably a good thing overall</a>,
in times like these you&#8217;d want to bring the &#8220;normal&#8221; behavior back. In zsh, it&#8217;s fortunately pretty&nbsp;simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find ${=d} -name &#39;*.py&#39;)
</pre></div>

is to use <code>eval</code>. Here, the <code>xargs</code> command can actually come in handy again, albeit only as a&nbsp;prop:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt | xargs echo); eval &quot;find $d -name &#39;*.py&#39;&quot;)
</pre></div>


<p>One would hope such hacks aren&#8217;t needed very&nbsp;often.</p>

If you need this exact form, probably the easiest way is to use plain old shell variables: $ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find $d -name '*.py') This takes advantage of the word splitting feature of Bash and a few other compatible shells. Caveat is, you may be using a shell where this behavior is disabled by default. The result would be making find interpret the content of $d as a single directory name: foo bar rather than foo and bar. zsh is one such shell. Although probably a good thing overall, in times like these you’d want to bring the “normal” behavior back. In zsh, it’s fortunately pretty simple: $ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find ${=d} -name '*.py') What about a portable solution? As far as I can tell, the only certain way you can ensure word splitting occurs is to use eval. Here, the xargs command can actually come in handy again, albeit only as a prop: $ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt | xargs echo); eval "find $d -name '*.py'") One would hope such hacks aren’t needed very often. A completely kosher version would also use the -print0 flag to find and the -0 flag to xargs. It’s not necessary here because Python module files cannot contain spaces. ↩ Purists shall excuse my use of cat here, it’s merely for illustrative purposes. ↩ This use of braces in find has of course nothing to do with the other possible occurrences of {} there, like in the -exec flag. Since you cannot force find to expect a different placeholder, you should use something else for xargs in those cases, .e.g: xargs -I^ find ^ -name '__main__.py' -exec 'python {}' \;. ↩"
