    <p><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> is a JavaScript &#8220;framework&#8221; that has always lurked in the shadows of other,
more flashy ones. Even in the days of its relative novelty, the likes of Backbone or Ember had seemed to garner more
widespread interest among frontend developers. Today, this hasn&#8217;t changed much, the difference being mainly
that the spotlight is now taken by new actors (<em>*cough*</em> <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> <em>*cough*</em>).</p>
<p>But Knockout has a loyal following, and for good reasons. Possibly the most imporant one is why I&#8217;ve put the word
&#8220;framework&#8221; in quotes. Knockout is, first and foremost, a <em>data binding</em> library: it doesn&#8217;t do much else besides
tying <span class="caps">DOM</span> nodes to JavaScript&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>This quality makes it both easy to learn and simple to integrate. In fact, it can very well live in just some small
compartments of your web application, mingling easily with any server-side templating mechanism you might be using.
It also interplays effortlessly with other <span class="caps">JS</span> libraries, and sticks very well to
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/30766900/434799">whatever duct tape you use</a> to hold your frontend stack&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>Lastly, it&#8217;s also quite extensible. We can, for example, create our own
<a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-syntax.html">bindings</a> rather easily, extending the declarative language
used to describe relationship between the data and <span class="caps">UI</span>.</p>
<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to demonstrate this by implementing a very simple <code>let:</code> binding &#8212;
a kind of &#8220;assignment&#8221; of an expression to a&nbsp;name.</p>
<h4>From Knockout <code>with:</code> bluff</h4>
<p>Out of box, Knockout proffers the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/with-binding.html"><code>with:</code> binding</a>,
a quite similar mechanism. How it may be somewhat problematic is analogous to the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with">widely discouraged <code>with</code> statement</a>
in JavaScript itself. Namely, it blends several namespaces together, making it harder to determine which object
is being referred to. As a result, the code is more prone to&nbsp;errors.</p>
<p>On the other hand, freeing the developer from repeating long and complicated expressions is obviously valuable.
Perhaps reducing them to nil is not the right approach, though, so how about we just shorten them
to a more manageable length? Well, that&#8217;s exactly what the <code>let:</code> binding is meant to&nbsp;do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;let: { addr: currentUser.personalInfo.address }&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: addr.line1&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- ko if: addr.line2 --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: addr.line2&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- /ko --&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: add.city&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>,
    <span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: add.region&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;text: add.country&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Making it happen turns out to be pretty&nbsp;easy.</p>
<h4>Binding&nbsp;contract</h4>
<p>To define a Knockout binding, up to two things are needed. We have to specify what the library should&nbsp;do:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the binding is first applied to a <span class="caps">DOM</span> node (the <code>init</code> method)</li>
<li>when any of the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html">observed values</a> changes (the <code>update</code> method)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every binding has to implement both methods. In our cases, only the <code>init</code> is necessary, because all we have to do
is modify the <em>binding context</em>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that? Shortly speaking, a <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-context.html">binding context</a>,
is an object holding all the data you can potentially bind to your <span class="caps">DOM</span> nodes. Think of it as a namespace, or local scope:
whatever&#8217;s in there can be used directly inside <code>data-bind</code> attributes.</p>
<h4><code>let:</code> it&nbsp;go</h4>
<p>Therefore, all that the <code>let:</code> binding has to do is to extend the context with a mapping passed to it as an argument.
Well, almost&nbsp;all:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">ko</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bindingHandlers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;let&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">init</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">valueAccessor</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">allBindings</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">viewModel</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">bindingContext</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">innerContext</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">bindingContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">valueAccessor</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nx">ko</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">applyBindingsToDescendants</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">innerContext</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">controlsDescendantBindings</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span> <span class="p">};</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The resulting <code>innerContext</code> is a copy of the original <code>bindingContext</code>, augmented with additional properties from
the argument of <code>let:</code> (those are available through <code>valueAccessor</code>). Once we have it, though, we need to handle it
in a little special&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Normally, Knockout is processing all bindings recursively, pasing down the same <code>bindingContext</code> (which ultimately
comes from the root <code>viewModel</code>). But since we want to locally alter the context, we also need to interrupt this regular
way and take care of the lower-level <span class="caps">DOM</span> nodes&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the overly-long <code>ko.applyBindingsToDescendants</code> function is doing. The only caveat is that Knockout
has to be <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/custom-bindings-controlling-descendant-bindings.html">told explicitly</a>
about our intentions through the <code>return</code> value from <code>init</code>. Otherwise, it would try to apply the <em>original</em>
<code>bindingContext</code> recursively, which in our case would amount to applying it <strong>twice</strong>.
<code>{ controlsDescendantBindings: true }</code> prevents Knockout from doing so&nbsp;erroneously.</p>

This is exactly what the overly-long ko.applyBindingsToDescendants function is doing. The only caveat is that Knockout has to be told explicitly about our intentions through the return value from init. Otherwise, it would try to apply the original bindingContext recursively, which in our case would amount to applying it twice. { controlsDescendantBindings: true } prevents Knockout from doing so erroneously."
