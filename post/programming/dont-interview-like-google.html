Whiteboard coding is how they are often called. It is a subject of an intense debate, whether or not they “work”, and adequately assess the engineering aptitude of candidates. If some high profile anecdotes are of any indication, the most common complaint is that they fail to recognize competence by ignoring previous professional work, open source contributions, conference talks, and so on. Instead, the whiteboard interview requires demand showing a “pure” problem solving ability within a relatively short time window, all without some broader context or even the usual tools of the trade: laptop, editor, and a search engine. As a Googler who had gone through this process and has now conducted a few of those interviews himself, I find those complaints mostly valid albeit misdirected. The problem isn’t really that Google interviews like it does. What’s really the issue is other companies implementing the same process, and not realizing it cannot possibly work for them. Somewhat special It is important to understand that Google’s stance on interviewing is influenced by some unique circumstances: very high and steady influx of potential candidates comparatively long tenure of the average engineer and the general focus on employee retention huge and mostly proprietary software stack working at a scale that almost no others do From this perspective, it makes sense to utilize cautious hiring strategies that may result in a high ratio of false negatives2.

To put it shortly, Google prefers you know CS rather than CSS. Finally, whiteboard coding is just one input to the evaluation process, but it tends to be the most trustworthy one. Besides programming aptitude, the ideal candidate would show a proven track record of technical leadership while tackling complex problems that span a broad scope. Unfortunately, those qualities are difficult to convey efficiently and reliably through the usual industry channels: a resume, references from previous jobs, GitHub profile, etc. Different conditions Given the above reasoning as to why “Google-style” interviews seem to work well for Google, I hope it’s evident why they are likely a poor choice for companies that don’t share the same characteristics as the Big 4. For one, it is highly unusual for a software shop in today’s market to command a sizeable pool for qualified candidates. Software engineering vacancies often go unfilled for weeks and months, even if the company isn’t exactly looking for “rockstars”, “ninjas”, “gunslingers”, or whatever the silly term du jour is. Those who meet the requirements usually have their pick at many different offers, too. The reality for many companies (especially startups) is also one where they are unable or unwilling to invest much in the retention of their employees. Because the employment relationship in this industry tends to be quite volatile (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing), it often makes sense for companies to look for a near-immediate payoff when hiring.

    <p>If you look at discussion forums for people in the <span class="caps">CS</span> industry &#8212;
like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/">/r/cscareequestions</a> or even just Hacker News &#8212;
you&#8217;ll find lots of talk about the so called <em>Big Four</em>&nbsp;companies.</p>
<p>This is mostly in the context of applying to them, or going through their interview process.
Which of the large software corporations are discussed here tends to fluctuate a little bit,
but both Google and Microsoft are invariably included, with Facebook popping up more often than&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Because of their privileged positions as very desirable places to work, these companies tend to be taken as models
for others to mimic<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Probably the most apparent and direct outcome is the increasing prevalence of
&#8220;Google-style&#8221; interviews, which are now utilized by countless software shops around the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p><em>Whiteboard coding</em> is how they are often called. It is a subject of an intense debate, whether or not they &#8220;work&#8221;,
and adequately assess the engineering aptitude of candidates. If some
<a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768">high profile anecdotes</a> are of any indication, the most common complaint
is that they fail to recognize competence by ignoring previous professional work, open source contributions,
conference talks, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Instead, the whiteboard interview requires demand showing a &#8220;pure&#8221; problem solving ability
within a relatively short time window, all without some broader context or even the usual tools of the trade:
laptop, editor, and a search&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>As a Googler who had gone through this process and has now conducted a few of those interviews himself,
I find those complaints mostly valid albeit&nbsp;misdirected.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t really that Google interviews like it&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really the issue is <em>other companies</em> implementing the same process, and not realizing it cannot possibly work for&nbsp;them.</p>
<h4>Somewhat&nbsp;special</h4>
<p>It is important to understand that Google&#8217;s stance on interviewing is influenced by some unique&nbsp;circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>very high and steady influx of potential&nbsp;candidates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comparatively long tenure of the average engineer and the general focus on employee&nbsp;retention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>huge and mostly proprietary software stack working at a scale that almost no others&nbsp;do</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From this perspective, it makes sense to utilize cautious hiring strategies that may result in a high ratio
of <em>false negatives</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. When rejections are cheap but the new hires are supposed to be here for the long run &#8212;

the benefit of the&nbsp;doubt.</p>
<p>The last point also explains why proficiency with specific technologies is less useful than
general flexibility grounded in strong fundamentals. To put it shortly, Google prefers you know
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"><span class="caps">CS</span></a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, whiteboard coding is just one input to the evaluation process, but it tends to be the most trustworthy one.
Besides programming aptitude, the ideal candidate would show a proven track record of technical leadership while
tackling complex problems that span a broad scope.<br>
Unfortunately, those qualities are difficult to convey <em>efficiently</em> and <em>reliably</em> through the usual industry channels:
a resume, references from previous jobs, GitHub profile,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<h4>Different&nbsp;conditions</h4>
<p>Given the above reasoning as to why &#8220;Google-style&#8221; interviews seem to work well for Google, I hope it&#8217;s evident why
they are likely a poor choice for companies that don&#8217;t share the same characteristics as the Big&nbsp;4.</p>
<p>For one, it is highly unusual for a software shop in today&#8217;s market to command a sizeable pool for qualified candidates.
Software engineering vacancies often go unfilled for weeks and months, even if the company isn&#8217;t exactly looking
