      <p>For work-related reasons,
I had to recently get up to speed on programming in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, I had very little actual experience with the language,
clocking probably at less than a thousand lines of working code over a couple of years.
Nothing impressive either:
some <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/b8fdb6a896264915ad85">wrapper script</a> here,
some <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/1525222">experimental rewrite</a>&nbsp;there&#8230;</p>
<p>These days, I heard, there are a few resources for learning Haskell<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
that don&#8217;t require having a PhD in category theory<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
They may be quite helpful when your exposure to the functional programming is limited.
In my case, however, the one thing that <em>really</em> enabled me to become (somewhat) productive
was not even related to Haskell at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>It was <a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>
<p>In theory, this shouldn&#8217;t really make much of a sense.
If you compare both languages by putting checkmarks in a feature chart,
you won&#8217;t find them to have much in&nbsp;common.</p>
<p>Some of the obvious differences&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>predominantly functional vs. mostly&nbsp;imperative</li>
<li>garbage collection vs. explicit memory&nbsp;management</li>
<li>lazy vs. eager&nbsp;evaluation</li>
<li>rich runtime<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> vs. almost no&nbsp;runtime</li>
<li>global vs. localized type&nbsp;inference</li>
<li>indentation vs.&nbsp;braces</li>
<li>two decades (!) vs. barely two years since&nbsp;release</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting aside syntax, most of those differences are pretty&nbsp;significant.</p>
<p>You probably wouldn&#8217;t use Haskell for embedded programming, for instance,
both for performance (<span class="caps">GC</span>) and memory usage reasons (laziness).
Similarly, Rust&#8217;s ownership system can be too much of a hassle for high level code
that isn&#8217;t subject to real time&nbsp;requirements.</p>
<p>But if you look a little deeper,
beyond just the surface descriptions of both languages,
you can find plenty of <em>concepts</em> they&nbsp;share.</p>
<h4>Traits: they are typeclasses,&nbsp;essentially</h4>
<p>Take Haskell&#8217;s typeclasses, for example &#8212;
the cornerstone of its rich and expressive type&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class"><em>typeclass</em></a> is, simply speaking,
a list of capabilities:
it defines what a type can <em>do</em>.
There exist analogs of typeclasses in most programming languages,
but they are normally called interfaces or protocols,
and remain closely tied to the object-oriented&nbsp;paradigm.</p>
<p>Not so in&nbsp;Haskell.</p>
<p>Or in Rust for that matter, where the equivalent concept exists under the name of <em>traits</em>.
What typeclasses and traits have in common is that
they&#8217;re used for <em>all kinds of polymorphism</em> in their respective&nbsp;languages.</p>
<h5>Generics</h5>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s consider <em>parametrized types</em>,
sometimes also referred to as templates (C++) or generics&nbsp;(C#).</p>
<p>In many cases, a generic function or type requires its type arguments
to exhibit certain characteristics.
In some languages (like the legacy C++), this is checked only implicitly:
as long as the template type-checks after its expansion, everything is&nbsp;okay:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">template</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="nl">b</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{};</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>  <span class="c1">// OK</span>
    <span class="n">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">());</span>  <span class="c1">// ERROR, no operator `&gt;`</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>More advanced type systems, however, allow to specify the generic constraints <em>explicitly</em>.
This is the case in&nbsp;Rust:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">min</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Ord</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">b</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">else</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>as well as in&nbsp;Haskell:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nf">min</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Ord</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span>
<span class="nf">min</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kr">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="kr">then</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="kr">else</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In both languages, the notion of a type supporting certain operations (like comparison/ordering)
is represented as its own, first-class concept:
a <em>trait</em> (Rust) or a <em>typeclass</em> (Haskell).
Since the compiler is aware of those constraints,
it can verify that the <code>min</code> function is used correctly even before
it tries to generate code for a specific substitution of <code>T</code>.</p>
<h5>Dynamic&nbsp;dispatch</h5>
<p>On the other hand, let&#8217;s look at <em>runtime polymorphism</em>:
the one that <span class="caps">OO</span> languages implement
through abstract base classes and virtual methods.
It&#8217;s the tool of choice if you need a container of objects of different types,
which nevertheless all expose the same&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>To offer it, Rust has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/trait-objects.html"><em>trait objects</em></a>,
and they work pretty much exactly like base class pointers/references from Java, C++, or&nbsp;C#.</p>

<p>The Haskell analogue is, in turn, based on typeclasses,
though the specifics can be a little bit&nbsp;trickier:</p>

<p>Here, the generic function can use typeclass constraints directly (<code>(Draw a) =&gt; ...</code>),
but creating a container of different object types requires a polymorphic wrapper<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h5>Differences</h5>
<p>All those similarities do not mean that
Rust traits and Haskell typeclasses are one and the same.
There are, in fact, quite a few differences, owing mostly to the fact that
Haskell&#8217;s type system is more&nbsp;expressive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rust lacks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_(type_theory)#Kinds_in_Haskell"><em>higher kinded types</em></a>,
  making certain abstractions impossible to encode as traits.
  It <em>is</em> possible, however, to implement a trait for infinitely many types at once
  if the <code>impl</code>ementation itself is generic
  (like <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/blob/2a9e427707cc93c716e011e99b0127f19cd770a5/src/lib/resources/mod.rs#L45">here</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When defining a trait in Rust, you can ask implementors to provide some auxiliary,
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/associated-types.html">associated types</a>
  in addition to just methods<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.
  A similar mechanism in Haskell is expanded into <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families">type families</a>,
  and requires enabling a <a href="https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2014-12-12-type-families.html"><span class="caps">GHC</span> extension</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While typeclasses in Haskell can be implemented for multiple types simultaneously
  via a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Multi-parameter_type_class"><span class="caps">GHC</span> extension</a>,
  Rust&#8217;s take on this feature is to make <em>traits themselves</em> generic (e.g. <code>trait Foo&lt;T&gt;</code>).
  The end result is roughly similar;
  however, the &#8220;main implementing type&#8221; (one after <code>for</code> in <code>impl ... for ...</code>)
  is still a method receiver (<code>self</code>), just like in <span class="caps">OO</span>&nbsp;languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust enforces <em>coherence rules</em> on trait implementations.
  The topic is actually
  <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/01/14/little-orphan-impls/">rather complicated</a>,
  but the gist is about local (current package) vs. remote (other packages / standard library)
  traits and types.<br>
  Without too much detail, coherence demands that there be a local type or trait
  somewhere in the <code>impl ... for ...</code> construct.
  Haskell doesn&#8217;t have this limitation,
  although it is recommended <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Orphan_instance">not to take advantage of this</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>The&nbsp;M-word</h4>
<p>Another area of overlap between Haskell and Rust exists
in the <em>data model</em> utilized by those languages.
Both are taking heavy advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type"><em>algebraic data types</em> (<span class="caps">ADT</span>)</a>,
including the ability to define both <em>product types</em> (&#8220;regular&#8221; structs and records)
as well as <em>sum types</em> (tagged&nbsp;unions).</p>
<h5><code>Maybe</code> you&#8217;d like <code>Some(T)</code>?</h5>
<p>Even more interestingly,
code in both languages makes extensive use of the two most basic&nbsp;ADTs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Option</code> (Rust) or <code>Maybe</code> (Haskell) &#8212;
  for denoting a presence or absence of a&nbsp;value</li>
<li><code>Result</code> (Rust) or <code>Either</code> (Haskell) &#8212;
  for representing the alternative of &#8220;correct&#8221; and &#8220;erroneous&#8221;&nbsp;value</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren&#8217;t just simple datatypes.
They are deeply interwoven into the basic semantics of both languages,
not to mention their standard libraries and community-provided&nbsp;packages.</p>
<p>The <code>Option</code>/<code>Maybe</code> type, for example,
is the alternative to <em>nullable references</em>:
something that&#8217;s been
<a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2015/08/31/the-worst-mistake-of-computer-science/">heavily criticized</a>
for making programs prone to unexpected <code>NullReferenceException</code>s.
The idea behind both of those types is to make actual values impossible to confuse with <code>null</code>s
by encoding the potential nullability into the type&nbsp;system:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">enum</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Option</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">None</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Maybe</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Just</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Nothing</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>Result</code> and <code>Either</code>, on the other hand,
can be thought as an extension of this idea.
They also represent two possibilities,
but the &#8220;wrong&#8221; one isn&#8217;t just <code>None</code> or <code>Nothing</code>
&#8212; it has some more information associated with&nbsp;it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">enum</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">E</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Err</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">E</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">Either</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Left</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="kt">Right</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This dichotomy between the <code>Ok</code> (or <code>Right</code>) value and the <code>Err</code>or value (or the <code>Left</code> one)
makes it a great vehicle for carrying results of functions that can <em>fail</em>.</p>
<p>In Rust, this replaces the traditional error handling mechanisms based on exceptions.
In Haskell, the exceptions are present and sometimes necessary,
but <code>Either</code> is nevertheless the preferred approach to dealing with&nbsp;errors.</p>
<h5>What to <code>do</code>?</h5>
<p>One thing that Haskell does better is <em>composing</em> those fallible functions
into bigger chunks of&nbsp;logic.</p>
<p>Relatively recently, Rust has added the <a href="https://m4rw3r.github.io/rust-questionmark-operator"><code>?</code> operator</a>
as a replacement for the <code>try!</code> macro.
This is now the preferred way of <em>error propagation</em>,
allowing for a more concise composition of functions that return <code>Result</code>s:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c-Doc">/// Read an integer from given file.</span>
<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">int_from_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nb">Path</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">result</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map_err</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">ErrorKind</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">InvalidData</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">?</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>But Haskell had it for much longer,
and it&#8217;s something of a hallmark of the language and functional programming in general
&#8212; even though it looks thoroughly <em>imperative</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nf">intFromFile</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">FilePath</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">IO</span> <span class="kt">Int</span>
<span class="nf">intFromFile</span> <span class="n">path</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kr">do</span>
    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="ow">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">readFile</span> <span class="n">path</span>
    <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">readIO</span> <span class="n">s</span>
    <span class="n">return</span> <span class="n">i</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen it before, this is of course a <em>monad</em> &#8212; the <code>IO</code> monad, to be precise.
While discussing monads in detail is way outside of the scope of this article,
we can definitely notice some analogies with Rust.
The <code>do</code> notation with <code>&lt;-</code> arrows is evidently similar to
how in Rust you&#8217;d assign the result of a fallible operation after &#8220;unpacking&#8221; it with <code>?</code>.</p>
<p>But of course,
there&#8217;s plenty of different monads in Haskell: not just <code>IO</code>,
but also <code>Either</code>, <code>Maybe</code>, <code>Reader</code>, <code>Writer</code>, <code>Cont</code>, <code>STM</code>, and many others.
In Rust (at least as of 1.19), the <code>?</code> operator only works for <code>Result</code> types,
although there is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1718">some talk</a>
about extending it to <code>Option</code> as well<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Eventually, we may see the language adopt some variant of the <code>do</code> notation,
though the motivation for this will most likely come from
<a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-await">asynchronous programming with <code>Future</code>s</a>
rather than plain <code>Result</code>s.
General monads, however, require support for <em>higher kinded types</em>
which <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/324">isn&#8217;t coming anytime soon</a>.</p>
<h4>A path through&nbsp;Rust?</h4>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve discussed those similarities,
the obvious question&nbsp;arises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is learning Rust worthwhile
if your ultimate goal is getting proficient at functional programming in general,
or Haskell in&nbsp;particular?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My answer to that is actually pretty&nbsp;straightforward.</p>
<p>If &#8220;getting to <span class="caps">FP</span>&#8221; is your main goal, then Rust will <em>not</em> help you very much.
Functional paradigm isn&#8217;t the main idea behind the language &#8212;
its shtick is mostly <em>memory safety</em>, and zero-cost abstractions.
While it succeeds somewhat at being &#8220;Haskell Lite&#8221;,
it really strives to be <em>safer C++</em><sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But if, on the other hand, you regard <span class="caps">FP</span> mostly as a curiosity
that seems to be seeping into your favorite imperative language at an increasing rate,
Rust can be a good way to gain familiarity with this peculiar&nbsp;beast.</p>
<p>At the very least, you will learn the functional way of <em>modeling programs</em>,
with lots of smart enums/unions and structs but without&nbsp;inheritance.</p>
<p>And the best part is: you will be so busy
<a href="https://m-decoster.github.io//2017/01/16/fighting-borrowchk/">fighting the borrow checker</a>
you won&#8217;t even notice when it happens&nbsp;;-)</p>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>If you followed the few (or a dozen) of my recent posts,
you&#8217;ve probably noticed a sizable bias in the choice of topics.
The vast majority were about <a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> &#8212;
a native, bare metal, statically typed language with powerful compile time semantics
but little in the way of runtime&nbsp;flexibility.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Rust is radically different than (almost the exact opposite of) Python,
the other language that I&#8217;m covering sometimes.
Considering this topical shift,
it would fair to assume that I, too, have subscribed to the whole Static Typing™&nbsp;trend.</p>
<p>But that wouldn&#8217;t be very&nbsp;accurate.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.
As far as fashion cycles in the software industry go,
the current trend towards static/compiled languages is difficult to disparage.
Strong in both hype <em>and</em> merit,
it has given us some <a href="http://rust-lang.org">really innovative</a>
<span class="amp">&amp;</span> <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">promising</a> solutions
(as well as some <a href="http://golang.org">not-so-innovative</a> ones)
that are poised to shape the future of programming for years, if not decades to come.
In many ways, it is also correcting mistakes of <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">the previous generation</a>:
excessive boilerplate, byzantine abstractions, and software&nbsp;bloat.</p>
<p>What about dynamic languages, then?
Are they slowly going the way of the&nbsp;dodo?</p>
<h4>Trigger warning: <code>TypeError</code></h4>
<p>Some programmers would certainly wish&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s not hard at all to find
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/06/why-do-dynamic-languages-make-it-difficult-to-maintain-large-codebases/">articles</a>
and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6aqksm/rust_productivity_compared_to_other_languages/dhgp037/">opinions</a>
about dynamic languages that are, well, less than&nbsp;flattering.</p>
<p>The common argument echoed in those accounts points to supposed unsuitability of Python et al.
for any large, multi-person project.
The reasoning can be summed up as &#8220;good for small scripts and not much else&#8221;.
Without statically checked types, the argument goes,
anything bigger than a quick hack or a prototype
shall inevitably become hairy and dangerous&nbsp;monstrosity.</p>
<p>And when that happens,
<em>a single typo</em> can go unchecked and bring down the entire&nbsp;system!&#8230;</p>
<p>At the very end of this spectrum of beliefs,
some pundits may eventually make the leap from languages to <em>people</em>.
If dynamically typed languages (or &#8220;untyped&#8221; ones, as they&#8217;re often mislabeled)
are letting even trivial bugs through,
then obviously anyone who wants to use them is
<a href="https://danluu.com/images/empirical-pl/pl_godwin.png">dangerously irresponsible</a>.
It must follow that all they <em>really</em> want is to hack up some shoddy code,
<em>yolo</em> it over to production, and let others worry about the&nbsp;consequences.</p>
<h4>Mind the&nbsp;gap</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s likely unproductive to engage with someone who&#8217;s that extreme.
If the rhetoric is dialed down, however, we can definitely find the edge of&nbsp;reason.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this fine line goes right through the &#8220;good in small quantities&#8221; argument.
I can certainly understand the apprehension towards large projects
that utilize dynamically typed languages throughout their codebases.
The prospect of such a project <em>is</em> scary,
because it contains an additional element of uncertainty.
More so than with many other technologies,
you ought to <em>know what you&#8217;re doing</em>.</p>
<p>Some people (and teams) do. Others, not so&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>I would therefore refine the argument
so that it better reflects the strengths and weaknesses of dynamic languages.
They are perfectly suited for at least the following&nbsp;cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>anyone writing small, standalone applications or&nbsp;scripts</li>
<li><em>any project</em> (large or small) with a well-functioning team of talented&nbsp;individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>The sad reality of the software industry is the vast, gaping chasm of calamity and despair
that stretches between those two&nbsp;scenarios.</p>
<p>Within lies the bulk of commercial software projects,
consistently hamstrung by the usual suspects:
incompetent management, unclear and shifting requirements, under- or overstaffing,
ancient development practices, lack of coding standards, rampant bureaucracy,
<a href="http://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">inexperienced developers</a>,
and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>In such an environment,
it becomes nigh impossible to capitalize on the strengths of dynamic languages.
Instead, the main priority is to protect from even further productivity losses,
which is what bog-standard languages like Java, C#, or Go tend to be pretty good at.
Rather than to move fast, the objective is to remain moving <em>at all</em>.</p>
<h4>Freedom of&nbsp;choice</h4>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>But that&#8217;s backwards&#8221;, the usual retort goes.
&#8220;Static typing and compilation checks are what <em>enables</em> me to be&nbsp;productive!&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no doubt that most people saying this do indeed believe
they&#8217;re better off programming in static languages.
Regardless of what they think, however,
there exists <a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/">no conclusive evidence</a>
to back up such claims as a universal&nbsp;rule.</p>
<p>This is of course the perennial problem with software engineering in general,
and the project management aspect of it in particular.
There is very little proper research on optimal and effective approaches to it,
which is why any of the so-called &#8220;best practices&#8221;
are quite likely to stem from <a href="https://leanpub.com/leprechauns">unsubstantiated hearsay</a>.</p>
<p>We can lament this state of affairs, of course.
But on the other hand, we can also find it <em>liberating</em>.
In the absence of rigid prescriptions and judgments about productivity,
we are free to explore, within technical limitations,
what language works best for us, our team, and our&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;ll be Go, Java, Rust, or even Haskell.<br>
A different situation may be best handled by Python, Ruby, or even&nbsp;JavaScript.</p>
<p>As the old adage goes, there is no silver bullet.
We should not try to polish static typing into&nbsp;one.</p>

      <p><em>&#8230;or: Is Rust&nbsp;webscale?</em></p>
<p>In this day and age, no language can really make an impact anymore
unless it enables its programmers to harness the power of the Internet.
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> is no different here.
Despite posing as a true systems language
(as opposed to those <a href="http://golang.org/">only marketed as such</a>),
it includes <a href="https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/roadmap-2017/text/0000-roadmap-2017.md#rust-should-be-well-equipped-for-writing-robust-high-scale-servers">highly scalable servers</a>
as a prominent objective in its 2017&nbsp;agenda.</p>
<p>Presumably to satisfy this very objective,
the Rust ecosystem has recently seen some major developments
in the space of <em>asynchronous I/O</em>.
Given the pace of those improvements,
it may seem that production quality async services are quite possible&nbsp;already.</p>
<p>But is that so?
How exactly do you write async Rust servers in the early to mid&nbsp;2017?</p>
<p>To find out, I set to code up a toy application.
Said program was a small intermediary/<span class="caps">API</span> server (a &#8220;microservice&#8221;, if you will)
that tries to hit many of the typical requirements that arise in such projects.
The main objective was to test the limits of asynchronous Rust,
and see how easily (or difficult) they can be&nbsp;pushed.</p>
<p>This post is a summary of all the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>It is necessarily quite long,
so if you look for some <span class="caps">TL</span>;<span class="caps">DR</span>, scroll down straight to <em>Conclusions</em>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://xion.io/images/jump-to-conclusions-mat.jpeg"></p>

<h4>Asynchro-what?</h4>
<p>Before we dive in, I have to clarify what &#8220;asynchronous&#8221; means in this context.
Those familiar with async concepts can freely skip this&nbsp;section.</p>
<h5>Pulling some&nbsp;threads</h5>
<p>Asynchronous processing (or <em>async</em> for short) is brought up most often
in the context of I/O operations: disk reads, network calls, database queries,
and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, all those tasks tend to be <em>slow</em>:
they take orders of magnitude longer than just executing code or even accessing <span class="caps">RAM</span>.
The &#8220;traditional&#8221; (synchronous) approach to dealing with them
is to relegate those tasks to separate <em>threads</em>.</p>
<p>When one thread has to wait for a lengthy I/O operation to complete,
the operating system (its <em>scheduler</em>, to be precise) can suspend that thread.
This lets others execute their code in the mean time and not waste <span class="caps">CPU</span>&nbsp;cycles.</p>
<p>This is the essence of <em>concurrency</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h5>Schedule&nbsp;yourself</h5>
<p>But threads are not the only option when dealing with many things (i.e. requests) at&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>The alternative approach is one where no threads are automatically suspended or resumed
by the <span class="caps">OS</span>. Instead, a special version of I/O subroutines
allows the program to continue execution immediately after issuing an I/O call.
While the operation happens in the background<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>,
the code is given an opaque handle &#8212; usually called a promise, a <em>future</em>,
or an async result &#8212; that will eventually resolve to the actual return&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>The program can wait for the handle synchronously,
but it would typically hand it over to an <em>event loop</em>,
an abstraction provided by a dedicated async framework.
Such a framework (among which node.js is probably the best known example)
maintains a list of all I/O &#8220;descriptors&#8221; (fds in Unix)
that are associated with pending I/O&nbsp;operations.</p>
<p>Then, in the loop, it simply waits on <em>all</em> of them,
usually via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll"><code>epoll</code> system call</a>.
Whenever an I/O task completes, the loop would execute a <em>callback</em> associated
with its result (or promise, or future).
Through this callback, the application is able to process&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>In a sense, we can treat the event loop as a dedicated scheduler for its&nbsp;program.</p>
<h5>But&nbsp;why?</h5>
<p>So, what exactly the benefit of asynchronous I/O?
If anything, it definitely sounds more complicated for the programmer. (Spoiler alert: it&nbsp;is).</p>
<p>The impetus for the development of async techniques most likely came from
the <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html"><span class="caps">C10K</span> problem</a>.
The short version of it is that computers are nowadays very fast
and should therefore be able to serve thousands of requests simultaneously.
(especially when those requests are mostly I/O, which translate to waiting time for the <span class="caps">CPU</span>).</p>
<p>And if &#8220;serving&#8221; queries is indeed almost all waiting,
then handling thousands of clients should be very&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>In some cases, however, it was found that when the <span class="caps">OS</span> is scheduling the threads,
it introduces too much overhead on the frequent pause/resume state changes (<em>context switching</em>).
Like I mentioned above, the asynchronous alternative does away with all that,
and indeed lets the <span class="caps">CPU</span> just wait (on <code>epoll</code>) until something interesting happens.
Once it does, the application can deal with it quickly,
issue another I/O call, and let the server go back to&nbsp;waiting.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s processing power we can theoretically handle
<em>a lot</em> of concurrent clients this way: up to hundreds of thousands or even&nbsp;millions.</p>
<h5>Reality&nbsp;check</h5>
<p>Well, ain&#8217;t that grand? No wonder everyone is writing everything in node.js&nbsp;now!</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the <em>actual</em> benefits of asynchronous I/O
(especially when weighed against its inconvenience for developers)
are a bit harder to quantify.
For one, they rely heavily on the assumption of fast code <span class="amp">&amp;</span> slow I/O being valid in all&nbsp;situations.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t really self-evident, and becomes increasingly dubious as time goes on
and code complexity grows.
It should be obvious, for example, that a Python web frontend
talking mostly to in-memory caches in the same datacenter will have radically different
performance characteristics than a C++ proxy server calling <span class="caps">HTTP</span> APIs over public Internet.
Those nuances are often lost in translation between simplistic benchmarks
and exaggerated blog posts<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Upon a closer look, however, these details point quite clearly in favor of asynchronous Rust.
Being a language that compiles to native code, it should usually run faster
than interpreted (Python, Ruby) or even JITed (<span class="caps">JVM</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> .<span class="caps">NET</span>) languages,
very close to what is typically referred to as &#8220;bare metal&#8221; speed.
For async I/O, it means the event loop won&#8217;t be disturbed for a (relatively) long time
to do some trivial processing, leading to higher potential throughput of&nbsp;requests.</p>
<p>All in all, it would seem that Rust is one of the few languages
where async actually <em>makes sense</em>.</p>
<h4>Rust: the story so&nbsp;far</h4>
<p>Obviously, this means it&#8217;s been built into the language right from the start&#8230;&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Well, not really.
It was always possible to use native <code>epoll</code> through <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ffi.html"><span class="caps">FFI</span></a>,
of course, but that&#8217;s not exactly the level of abstraction we&#8217;d like to work with.
Still, the upper layers of the async I/O stack have been steadily growing at least since Rust&nbsp;1.0.</p>
<p>The major milestones here include <a href="https://docs.rs/mio"><em>mio</em></a>,
a comparatively basic building block that provides an asynchronous version of <span class="caps">TCP</span>/<span class="caps">IP</span>.
It also offers idiomatic wrappers over <code>epoll</code>, allowing us to write our own event&nbsp;loop.</p>
<p>On the application side, <a href="https://docs.rs/futures">the <em>futures</em> crate</a> abstracts the notion
of a potentially incomplete operation into, well, a <em>future</em>.
Manipulating those futures is how one can now write asynchronous code in&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="http://tokio.rs">Tokio</a> has been emerging as
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/04/10/mozilla-awards-365000-to-open-source-projects-as-part-of-moss/"><em>defacto</em> framework</a>
for async I/O in Rust. It essentially combines the two previously mentioned crates,
and provides additional abstractions specifically for network clients and&nbsp;servers.</p>
<p>And finally, the popular <span class="caps">HTTP</span> framework <a href="http://hyper.rs">Hyper</a> is now also supporting
asynchronous request handling via Tokio.
What this means is that bread-and-butter of the Internet&#8217;s application layer &#8212;
<span class="caps">API</span> servers talking <span class="caps">JSON</span> over <span class="caps">HTTP</span> &#8212; should now be fully supported by the ecosystem
of asynchronous&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take it for a spin then, shall&nbsp;we?</p>
<h4>The Grand&nbsp;Project</h4>
<p>Earlier on, we have established that the main use case for asynchronous I/O
is intermediate microservices.
They often sit somewhere between a standard web frontend and a storage server or a database.
Because of their typical role within a bigger system,
these kinds of projects don&#8217;t tend to be particularly exciting on their&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>But perhaps we can liven them up a&nbsp;little.</p>
<p>In the end, it is all about the Internet that we&#8217;re talking here,
and everything on the Internet can usually be improved by one simple&nbsp;addition.</p>
<p align="center">

        </a>
    </small>
</p>

<p>&#8230;Okay, <em>two</em> possible additions &#8212; the other one&nbsp;being:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://xion.io/images/oprah-memes.png" alt="Memes!"></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re really pedantic, you may call them <em>image macros</em>.
But regardless of the name, the important part is putting text on pictures,
preferably in a funny&nbsp;way.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld">The microservice I wrote</a> is doing just that.
Thought it won&#8217;t ensure your memes are sufficiently hilarious,
it will try to deliver them exactly to
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/blob/e25e9d01bdd7e85452e6a5922770dae941d5b61c/src/caption/mod.rs#L32">your specifications</a>.
You may thus think of it as possible backend for
<a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/caption">an image site like this one</a>.</p>
<h5>Flimsy excuses <span class="amp">&amp;</span> post-hoc&nbsp;justifications</h5>
<p>It is, of course, a <em>complete</em> coincidence,
lacking <em>any</em> premeditation on my part,
that when it comes to evaluating an async platform,
a service like this fits the bill <em>very well</em>.</p>
<p>And especially when said platform is async <em>Rust</em>.</p>
<p>Why, though, is it such a happy, er,&nbsp;accident?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a simple, well-defined application</strong>.
  There is basically a <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/blob/e25e9d01bdd7e85452e6a5922770dae941d5b61c/src/service.rs#L33">single endpoint</a>,
  accepting simple input (<span class="caps">JSON</span> or query string) and producing a straightforward result (an image).
  No need to persist any state made creating
  <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/blob/8026eab34ea54c4ba1b814c1114b3f5d87020233/src/main.rs">an <span class="caps">MVP</span></a>
  significantly&nbsp;easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching can be used for meme templates and fonts.</strong>
  Besides being an inherent part of most network services,
  a cache also represents a point of contention for Rust programs.
  The language is widely known for its alergy to global mutable state,
  which is exactly what programmatic caches boil down&nbsp;to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Image captioning is a <span class="caps">CPU</span>-intensive operation.</strong>
  While the &#8220;async&#8221; part of async I/O may sometimes go all the way down,
  many practical services either evolve some important <span class="caps">CPU</span>-bound code,
  or require it right from the start.
  For this reason, I wanted to check if <span class="amp">&amp;</span> how async Rust can mix
  with threaded&nbsp;concurrency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration knobs can be added.</strong>
  Unlike trivial experiments in the vein of an echo or &#8220;Hello world&#8221; server,
  this kind of service warrants some flags that the user could tweak,
  like the number of image captioning threads, or the size of the template cache.
  We can see how easy (or how hard) it is to make them applicable across
  all future-based&nbsp;requests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, and despite its frivolous subject matter,
a meme server is actually hitting quite a few notable spots in the microservice&nbsp;domain.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/meme-shocked.png" alt="">
</p>

<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>As you may glean from its <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld">GitHub repo</a>,
it would seem that the experiment was successful.
Sure, you could implement some features in the captioning department
(supporting animated GIFs comes to mind),
but none of these are pertinent to the async mechanics of the&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>And since it&#8217;s the async (I/O) in Rust that we&#8217;re interested in,
let me now present you with an assorted collection of practical experiences with&nbsp;it.</p>
<h5>&gt;0-cost&nbsp;futures</h5>
<p>If you read the docs&#8217; preamble to <a href="https://docs.rs/futures">the <code>futures</code> crate</a>,
you will see it mentioning the &#8220;zero-cost&#8221; aspect of the library.
Consistent with the philosophy behind Rust,
it proclaims to deliver its abstractions without any&nbsp;overhead.</p>
<p>Thing is, I&#8217;m not sure how this promise can be delivered on in&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p>Flip through <a href="https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/simple-server/">the introductory tutorial to Tokio</a>,
for example, and you will already find plenty of compromises.
Without the crucial (but nightly-only)
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1522-conservative-impl-trait.md"><code>impl Trait</code> feature</a>,
you are basically required to put all your futures in a <code>Box</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
They even encourage it themselves, offering a convenient
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.13/futures/future/trait.Future.html#method.boxed"><code>Future::boxed</code> method</a>
exactly for this purpose, as well the matching
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.13/futures/future/type.BoxFuture.html"><code>BoxFuture</code> typedef</a>
right in the&nbsp;crate.</p>
<p>But hey, you can always just use nightly Rust, right?
<code>impl Trait</code> will stabilize eventually, so your code should be, ahem, <em>future-proof</em> either&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this assumes all the futures that you&#8217;re building your request handlers from
shall never cross any thread boundaries.
(<code>BoxFuture</code>, for example, automatically constrains them to be <code>Send</code>).
As you&#8217;ve likely guessed, this doesn&#8217;t jive very well with computationally intensive tasks
which are best relegated to a separate&nbsp;thread.</p>
<p>To deal with them properly, you&#8217;re going to need a thread pool-based executor,
which is currently implemented in the <a href="https://docs.rs/futures-cpupool"><code>futures_cpupool</code> crate</a>.
Using it requires a lot of care, though,
and a deep understanding of <em>both</em> types of concurrency&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p>Evidently, this was something that I lacked at the time,
which is why I encountered problems ensuring that my futures are properly <code>Send</code>.
In the end, I settled on <em>making</em> them <code>Send</code> in the most straightforward
(and completely <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/commit/19d37cef4bb2e917e54c862ef138c7da4378d03e">unnecessary</a>) manner:
by <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/blob/7e7d3b160594689d2e4c80b7328f90f34546b955/src/ext.rs#L39">wrapping them in <code>Arc</code>/<code>Mutex</code></a>.
That in itself wasn&#8217;t
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/commit/15bcd60f76a97badb9b90721179daa0845b139dd#diff-126a37e2b594610dd09c3f228d9d1717L52">without its perils</a>,
but at least allowed me to move&nbsp;forward.</p>
<p>Ironically, this also shows an important, pragmatic property of the futures&#8217; system:
sub-par hacks around it <em>are</em> possible &#8212;
a fact you&#8217;ll be glad to know about on the proverbial day before a&nbsp;deadline.</p>
<h5>Templates-worthy error&nbsp;messages</h5>
<p>Other significant properties of the futures&#8217; abstraction shall include
telling the programmer what&#8217;s wrong with his code in the simplest,
most straightforward, and concise manner&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Here, let me show you an&nbsp;example:</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/rust-futures-error.png"><br>
    <small>
        &#8230;which you can also behold in its
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/df1fb7fffa1afb4bfbf2838b9c3fc4c1">
            gist form
        </a>.
    </small>
</p>

<p>The reason you will encounter such incomprehensible messages
stems from the very building blocks of async&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Right now, each chained operation on a future &#8212; <code>map</code>, <code>and_then</code>, <code>or_else</code>, and so on &#8212;
produces a <em>nested type</em>.
Every subsequent application of those methods
&#8220;contains&#8221; (in terms of the type system) <em>all the previous ones</em>.
Keep going, and it will eventually balloon into one big onion of <code>Chain&lt;Map&lt;OrElse&lt;Chain&lt;Map&lt;...etc...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/meme-yo-dawg.jpeg"><br>
    <small>Futures are like ogres.</small>
</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t personally hit any compiler limits in this regard,
but I&#8217;m sure it is plausible for a complicated, real-world&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>It also gets <em>worse</em> if you use nightly Rust with <code>impl Trait</code>.
In this case, function boundaries no longer &#8220;break&#8221; type stacking
via <code>Box</code>ing the results into trait objects.
Indeed, you can very well end up with some truly gigantic constructs
as the compiler tries represent the return types of your most complex&nbsp;handlers.</p>
<p>But even if rustc is up to snuff and can deal with those fractals just fine,
it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the <em>programmer</em> can.
Looking at those error messages,
I had vivid flashbacks from hacking on C++ templates with ancient compilers like <span class="caps">VS2005</span>.
The difference is, of course, that we&#8217;re not trying any arcane metaprogramming here;
we just want to do some relatively mundane&nbsp;I/O.</p>
<p>I have no doubt the messaging will eventually improve,
and the mile-long types will at least get pretty-printed.
At the moment, however, prepare for some serious squinting and&nbsp;bracket-counting.</p>
<h5>Where is my (language)&nbsp;support?</h5>
<p>Sadly, those long, cryptic error messages are not the only way
in which the Rust compiler disappoints&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>I keep mentioning <code>impl Trait</code> as a generally desirable language feature
for writers of asynchronous code.
This improvement is still a relatively long way from getting precisely
<a href="https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/expand-impl-trait/text/0000-expand-impl-trait.md"><em>defined</em></a>,
much less stabilized.
And it is only a somewhat minor improvement in the async&nbsp;ergonomics.</p>
<p>The wishlist is vastly longer and even more&nbsp;inchoate.</p>
<p>Saying it bluntly, right now Rust doesn&#8217;t really support the async style <em>at all</em>.
All the combined <span class="caps">API</span> surface of futures/Tokio/Hyper/etc. is a clever,
but ultimately contrived design,
and it has no intentional backing in the Rust language&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>This is a stark contrast with numerous other languages.
They often support asynchronous I/O as something of a first class feature.
The list includes at least
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt674882.aspx">C#</a>,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">Python 3.5+</a>,
<a href="https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/async/awaitables">Hack/<span class="caps">PHP</span></a>,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"><span class="caps">ES8</span> / JavaScript</a>,
and basically all the functional languages.
They all have dedicated <code>async</code>, <code>await</code>, or equivalent constructs
that make the callback-based nature of asynchronous code essentially&nbsp;transparent.</p>
<p>The absence of similar support puts Rust in the same bucket as frontend JavaScript circa 2010,
where <code>.then</code>-chaining of promises reigned supreme.
This is of course better than the callback hell of early Node,
but I wouldn&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a particularly high bar.
In this regard, Rust leaves plenty to be&nbsp;desired.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/vadimcn/rfcs/blob/coroutines2/text/0000-coroutines.md">proposals</a>,
obviously, to bring async coroutines into Rust.
There is an even broader wish to make the language cross the <span class="caps">OOP</span>/<span class="caps">FP</span> fence already
and commit to the functional way; this would mean adding an equivalent of Haskell&#8217;s <code>do</code> notation.</p>
<p>Either development could be sufficient.
Both, however, require significant amount of design and implementation work.
If solved now, this would easily be the most significant addition to the language
since its 1.0 release &#8212; but the solution is currently in the <span class="caps">RFC</span> stages <em>at best</em>.</p>
<h5>Future&lt;Ecosystem&gt;</h5>
<p>While the core language support is lacking,
the great as usual Rust community has been picking up some of the slack
by establishing and cultivating a steadily growing&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<p>The constellation of async-related crates clusters mostly around the two core libraries:
<code>futures</code> crate itself and Tokio.
Any functionality you may need while writing asynchronous should likely be found
quite easily by searching for one of those two keywords (plus Rust, of course).
Another way of finding what you need is to look at
<a href="https://tokio.rs/docs/going-deeper-tokio/third-party/">the list of Tokio-related crates</a>&nbsp;directly.</p>
<p>To be fair, I can&#8217;t really say much about the completeness of this ecosystem.
The project didn&#8217;t really require too many external dependencies &#8212;
the only relevant ones&nbsp;were:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>futures_cpupool</code> mentioned&nbsp;before</li>
<li><code>tokio-timer</code> for imposing a timeout on caption&nbsp;requests</li>
<li><code>tokio-signal</code> which handles <span class="caps">SIGINT</span>/Ctrl+C  and allows for a graceful&nbsp;shutdown</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, you&#8217;d also want to research the async database drivers
for your storage system of choice.
I would not expect anything resembling the <a href="http://diesel.rs">Diesel</a> <span class="caps">ORM</span> crate, though,
nor a web framework comparable to <a href="http://ironframework.io/">Iron</a>,
<a href="https://fengsp.github.io/pencil/pencil/">Pencil</a>,
or <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>Alright, so what can we get from this overall&nbsp;analysis?</p>
<p>Given the rapid development of async Rust ecosystem so far,
it is clear the technology is very promising.
If the community maintains its usual enthusiasm and keeps funneling it into Tokio et al.,
it won&#8217;t be long before it matures into something&nbsp;remarkable.</p>
<p>Right now, however, it exposes way too many rough edges to fully bet on it.
Still, there may be some applications
where you could get away with an async Rust backend even in production.
But personally, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it outside of non-essential services,
or tools internal to your&nbsp;organization.</p>
<p>If you do use async Rust for microservices,
I&#8217;d also advise to take steps to ensure they remain &#8220;micro&#8221;.
Like I&#8217;ve elaborated in the earlier sections,
there are several issues that make future-based Rust code scale poorly
with respect to maintainability.
Keeping it simple is therefore&nbsp;essential.</p>
<p>To sum up, async Rust is currently an option only for the adventurous and/or small.
Others should stick to a tried <span class="amp">&amp;</span> tested solution:
something like Java (with <a href="http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/">Quasar</a>),
.<span class="caps">NET</span>, Go, or perhaps node.js at the very&nbsp;least.</p>

and then implement the necessary trait for it.<br>
For iterators, this works reasonably well,
and you don&#8217;t need custom ones that often anyway.
But futures, by their very nature, are meant to encapsulate <em>any</em> computation.
For them, &#8220;each individual case&#8221; is literally <em>every asynchronous function</em> in your code.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Towards the end of <a href="http://xion.io/post/code/rust-for-loop.html">my previous post about <code>for</code> loops in Rust</a>,
I mentioned how those loops can often be expressed in a more declarative way.
This alternative approach involves chaining methods of
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html">the <code>Iterator</code> trait</a>
to create specialized transformation&nbsp;pipelines:</p>

<p><small><a href="https://is.gd/q4lXew">Playground link</a></small></p>
<p>Code like this isn&#8217;t unique to Rust, of course.
Similar patterns are prevalent in functional languages such as
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/operators.%5b-h%5d-%5d%5b't1%2c'u%5d-function-%5bfsharp%5d">F#</a>,
and can also be found in
Java (<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-java-8-streams-1">Streams</a>),
imperative .<span class="caps">NET</span> (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx#linqoverview_topic3"><span class="caps">LINQ</span></a>),
JavaScript (<a href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#chain">LoDash</a>)
and&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
<p>This saying, Rust also has its fair share of unique iteration idioms.
In this post, we&#8217;re going to explore those arising on the intersection of iterators
and the most common Rust enums: <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code>.</p>
<h4>filter_map()</h4>
<p>When working with iterators,
we&#8217;re almost always interested in selecting elements that match some criterion
or passing them through a transformation function.
It&#8217;s not even uncommon to want <em>both</em> of those things,
as demonstrated by the initial example in this&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>You can, of course, accomplish those two tasks independently:
Rust&#8217;s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.filter"><code>filter</code></a>
and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.map"><code>map</code></a> methods
work just fine for this purpose.
But there exists an alternative, and in some cases it fits the problem <em>amazingly</em>&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Meet <code>filter_map</code>.
Here&#8217;s what <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.filter_map">the official docs</a>
have to say about&nbsp;it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creates an iterator that both filters and&nbsp;maps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, <em>duh</em>.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, the common pattern that <code>filter_map</code> simplifies
is unwrapping a series of <code>Option</code>s.
If you have a sequence of maybe-values,
and you want to retain only those that are actually there,
<code>filter_map</code> can do it in a single&nbsp;step:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// Get the sequence of all files matching a glob pattern via the glob crate.</span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">some_files</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">glob</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">glob</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;foo.*&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">());</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="c1">// Retain only their extensions, e.g. &quot;.txt&quot; or &quot;.md&quot;.</span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">file_extensions</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">some_files</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">filter_map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">extension</span><span class="p">());</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>The equivalent that doesn&#8217;t use <code>filter_map</code>
would have to split the checking <span class="amp">&amp;</span> unwrapping of <code>Option</code>s into separate&nbsp;steps:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">file_extensions</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">some_files</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">extension</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">is_some</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">());</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Because of this check <span class="amp">&amp;</span> unwrap logic,
<code>filter_map</code> can be useful even with a no-op predicate (<code>.filter_map(|x| x)</code>)
if we already have the <code>Option</code> objects handy.
Otherwise, it&#8217;s often very easy to obtain them,
which is exactly the case for the <code>Result</code> type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// Read all text lines from a file:</span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">lines</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">BufReader</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fs</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">File</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;file.ext&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">?</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">lines</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">filter_map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>With a simple <code>.filter_map(Result::ok)</code>, like above,
we can pass through a sequence of <code>Result</code>s and yield only the &#8220;successful&#8221; values.
I find this particular idiom to be extremely useful in practice,
as long as you remember that <code>Err</code>ors will be discarded by it<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As a final note on <code>filter_map</code>,
you need to keep in mind that regardless of how great it often is,
not all combinations of <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> should be replaced by it.
When deciding whether it&#8217;s appropriate in your case,
it is helpful to consider the equivalence of these two&nbsp;expressions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">iter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">iter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">filter_map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">else</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">None</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">})</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Simply put, if you find yourself writing conditions like this inside <code>filter_map</code>,
you&#8217;re probably better off with two separate processing&nbsp;steps.</p>
<h4>collect()</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to the last example with a sequence of <code>Result</code>s.
Since the final sequence won&#8217;t include any <code>Err</code>oneous values,
you may be wondering if there is a way to preserve&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>In more formal terms, the question is about turning a vector of results
(<code>Vec&lt;Result&lt;T, E&gt;&gt;</code>) into a result with a vector (<code>Result&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;, E&gt;</code>).
We&#8217;d like for this aggregated result to only be <code>Ok</code>
if <em>all</em> original results were <code>Ok</code>.
Otherwise, we should just get the first <code>Err</code>or.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, but this is probably <em>the</em> most common Rust problem!<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the problem is particularly hard.
Possible solutions exist in both an iterator&nbsp;version:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">result</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">into_iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">fold</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">vec</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">[]),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">|</span><span class="k">mut</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">match</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>but I suspect not many people would call them clear and readable,
let alone pretty<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you don&#8217;t need to pollute your codebase with any of those workarounds.
Rust offers an out-of-the-box solution which solves this particular problem,
and its only flaw is one that I hope to address through this very&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>So, here it&nbsp;goes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">result</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Yep, that&#8217;s all of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The background story is that <code>Result&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;, E&gt;</code> simply &#8220;knows&#8221;
how to construct itself from a sequence of <code>Result</code>s.
Unfortunately, this <span class="caps">API</span> is hidden behind Rust&#8217;s iterator abstraction,
and specifically the fact that
<code>Result</code> implements <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.2.0/std/iter/trait.FromIterator.html"><code>FromIterator</code></a>
in this particular manner.
The way
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html">the documentation page for <code>Result</code></a>
is structured, however &#8212; with trait implementations at the very end &#8212;
ensures this useful fact remains virtually&nbsp;undiscoverable.</p>
<p>Because let&#8217;s be honest: no one scrolls that&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>Incidentally, <code>Option</code> offers analogous functionally:
a sequence of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> can be <code>collect</code>ed into <code>Option&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>,
which will be <code>None</code> if any of the input elements were.
As you may suspect, this fact is equally hard to find in the relevant&nbsp;docs.</p>
<p>But the good news is: you know about all this now! :)
And perhaps thanks to this post,
those handy tricks become a little better in a wider Rust&nbsp;community.</p>
<h4>partition()</h4>
<p>The last technique I wanted to present here follows naturally
from the other idioms that apply to <code>Result</code>s.
Instead of extracting just the <code>Ok</code> values with <code>flat_map</code>,
or keeping only the first error through <code>collect</code>,
we will now learn how to retain all the errors <em>and</em> all the values,
both neatly&nbsp;separated.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.partition"><code>partition</code> method</a>,
as this is what the section is about,
is essentially a more powerful variant of <code>filter</code>.
While the latter only returns items that <em>do</em> match a predicate,
<code>partition</code> will also give us the ones which <em>don&#8217;t</em>.</p>
<p>Using it to slice an iterable of <code>Result</code>s is&nbsp;straightforward:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">oks</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">fails</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">partition</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">is_ok</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>The only thing that remains cumbersome is
the fact that both parts of the resulting tuple still contain just <code>Result</code>s.
Ideally, we would like them to be already unwrapped into values and errors,
but unfortunately we need to do this&nbsp;ourselves:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">values</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">oks</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">into_iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">errors</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">fails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">into_iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">unwrap_err</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>As an alternative,
<a href="https://docs.rs/itertools/0.6.0/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.partition_map">the <code>partition_map</code> method</a>
from the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/itertools"><code>itertools</code> crate</a>
can accomplish the same thing in a single step,
albeit a more verbose&nbsp;one.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />

<li id="fn:1">
<p>A symmetrical technique is to use <code>.filter_map(Result::err)</code> to get just

  <div>
      <p>In Python, a <em>generator function</em> is one that
contains a <code>yield</code> statement inside the function body.
Although this language construct has many fascinating use cases
(<a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/Coroutines.pdf"><span class="caps">PDF</span></a>),
the most common one is creating concise and readable&nbsp;iterators.</p>
<h4>A typical&nbsp;case</h4>
<p>Consider, for example, this simple&nbsp;function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">of</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Yields all multiples of given integer.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">of</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">of</span>
</pre></div>


<p>which creates an (infinite) iterator over all multiples of given integer.
A sample of its output looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">itertools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">islice</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">islice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">of</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">35</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">45</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you were to replicate in a language such as Java or Rust
&#8212; neither of which supports an equivalent of <code>yield</code> &#8212;
you&#8217;d end up writing an <em>iterator</em> class.
Python also has them, of&nbsp;course:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Yields all multiples of given integer.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">of</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">of</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">of</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">current</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__iter__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span>

<p>but they are usually not the first choice<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also pretty easy to see why:
they require explicit bookkeeping of any auxiliary state between iterations.
Perhaps it&#8217;s not too much to ask for a trivial walk over integers,
but it can get quite tricky if we were to iterate over recursive data structures,
like trees or graphs. In <code>yield</code>-based generators, this isn&#8217;t a problem,
because the state is stored within local variables on the coroutine&nbsp;stack.</p>
<h4>Lazy!</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember, however, that
generator functions behave differently than regular functions do,
even if the surface appearance often says&nbsp;otherwise.</p>
<p>The difference I wanted to explore in this post becomes apparent
when we add some argument checking to the initial&nbsp;example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">of</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Yields all multiples of given integer.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;expected a natural number, got </span><span class="si">%r</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">of</span><span class="p">,))</span>

    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">of</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">of</span>
</pre></div>


<p>With that <code>if</code> in place, passing a negative number shall result in an exception.
Yet when we attempt to do just that, it will seem as if nothing is&nbsp;happening:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And to a certain degree, this is pretty much correct.
Simply <em>calling</em> a generator function does comparatively little,
and doesn&#8217;t actually execute any of its code!
Instead, we get back a <em>generator object</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">m</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">generator</span> <span class="nb">object</span> <span class="n">multiples</span> <span class="n">at</span> <span class="mh">0x10f0ceb40</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>which is essentially a built-in analogue to the <code>Multiples</code> iterator instance.
Commonly, it is said that both generator functions and iterator classes are <em>lazy</em>:
they only do work when we asked (i.e. iterated&nbsp;over).</p>
<h4>Getting&nbsp;eager</h4>
<p>Oftentimes, this is perfectly okay.
The laziness of generators is in fact one of their great strengths,
which is particularly evident in the <a href="https://pymotw.com/2/itertools/">immense usefulness</a>
of <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html">the<code>itertools</code> module</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however,
delaying argument checks and similar operations until later may hamper debugging.
The classic engineering principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast">failing fast</a>
applies here very fittingly: any errors should be signaled immediately.
In Python, this means raising exceptions as soon as problems are&nbsp;detected.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is possible to reconcile the benefits of laziness
with (more) defensive programming.
We can make the generator functions only a <em>little</em> more eager,
just enough to verify the correctness of their&nbsp;arguments.</p>
<p>The trick is simple. We shall extract an <em>inner</em> generator function
and only call it after we have checked the&nbsp;arguments:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">of</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Yields all multiples of given integer.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;expected a natural number, got </span><span class="si">%r</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">of</span><span class="p">,))</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multiples</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">of</span>
        <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
            <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">of</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">multiples</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>From the caller&#8217;s point of view, nothing has changed in the typical&nbsp;case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">generator</span> <span class="nb">object</span> <span class="n">multiples</span> <span class="n">at</span> <span class="mh">0x110579190</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>but if we try to make an incorrect invocation now,
the problem is detected <em>immediately</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;pyshell#2&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    multiples(of=-5)
  File &quot;&lt;pyshell#0&gt;&quot;, line 4, in multiples
    raise ValueError(&quot;expected a natural number, got %r&quot; % (of,))
ValueError: expected a natural number, got -5
</pre></div>


<p>Pretty neat, especially for something that requires only two lines of&nbsp;code!</p>
<h4>The last&nbsp;(micro)optimization</h4>
<p>Indeed, we didn&#8217;t even have to pass the arguments to the inner (generator) function,
because they are already captured by the&nbsp;closure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this also has a slight performance cost.
A captured variable (also known as a <em>cell variable</em>) is stored on the function object itself,
so Python has to emit
<a href="http://holdenweb.blogspot.com/2014/07/closures-arent-easy.html">a different bytecode instruction</a>
(<code>LOAD_DEREF</code>) that involves
an <a href="http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2015/12/how-lookup-works.html">extra pointer dereference</a>.
Normally, this is not a problem, but in a tight generator loop it can make a&nbsp;difference.</p>
<p>We can eliminate this extra work<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> by passing the parameters&nbsp;explicitly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="c"># (snip)</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">of</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">of</span>
        <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
            <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">of</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">multiples</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">of</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This turns them into local variables of the inner function,
replacing the <code>LOAD_DEREF</code> instructions with (aptly named) <code>LOAD_FAST</code> ones.</p>
<div class="footnote">

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Here&#8217;s a neat little trick
that&#8217;s especially useful if you&#8217;re just starting out with&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<p>Because the language uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">type inference</a> all over the place
(or at least within a single function),
it can often be difficult to figure out the type of an expression by yourself.
Such knowledge is very handy in resolving compiler errors,
which may be rather complex when generics and traits are&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p>The formula itself is very simple.
Its shortest, most common version &#8212; and arguably the cleverest one, too &#8212;
is the following <code>let</code> binding:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">some_expression</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>In virtually all cases, this binding will cause a type error on its own,
so it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;d leave permanently in your regular&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>But the important part here is the exact error message you&nbsp;get:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:42:13
   |
42 |         let () = some_expression;
   |             ^^ expected f64, found ()
   |
   = note: expected type `f64`
   = note:    found type `()`
</pre></div>


<p>The type expected by Rust here (in this example, <code>f64</code>)
is also the type of <code>some_expression</code>. No more, no&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>There is nothing particularly wrong with using this technique
and not caring too much how it works under the hood.
But if you do want to know a little more what exactly is going on here,
the rest of this post covers it in some&nbsp;detail.</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;unit</h4>
<p>Firstly, you may be wondering about this curious <code>()</code> type
that the compiler has apparently found in the statement above.
The official name for it is the <em>unit type</em>,
and it has several notable&nbsp;characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>There exists only one value<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of this type: <code>()</code> (same symbol as the type&nbsp;itself).</li>
<li>It represents an empty tuple and has therefore the size of&nbsp;zero.</li>
<li>It is the type of any expression that&#8217;s turned into a <em>statement</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That last fact is particularly interesting,
as it makes <code>()</code> appear in error messages that are more indicative of syntactic mishaps
rather than mismatched&nbsp;types:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">positive_signum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="k">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="k">i32</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre>error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:2:17
  |
2 |     if x &gt; 0 { 1i32 }
  |                ^^^^ expected (), found i32
  |
  = note: expected type `()`
  = note:    found type `i32`
</pre></div>


<p>If you think about it, however, it makes perfect sense.
The last expression inside a function body is the return value.
This also means that everything <em>before</em> it has to be a statement:
an expression of type <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>Working its way backward,
Rust will therefore expect only such expressions before the final <code>0i32</code>.
This, in turn, puts the same constraint on the body of the <code>if</code> statement.
The expression <code>1i32</code> (with its type of <code>i32</code>) clearly violates it,
causing the above error<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h4><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Expanded&#8221;&nbsp;version</h4>
<p>A natural question now arises:
is <code>()</code> inside of the <code>let () = ...</code> formula a <em>type</em> <code>()</code> or a <em>value</em> <code>()</code>?&#8230;</p>
<p>To answer that,
it&#8217;s quite helpful to compare and contrast the original binding with its longer&nbsp;&#8220;equivalent&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">some_expression</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>This statement is conceptually very similar to our original one.
The error message it causes can also be used to debug issues with type&nbsp;inference.</p>
<p>Despite some cryptic symbols, the syntax here should also be more familiar.
It occurs in many typical, ordinary bindings you can see in everyday Rust code.
Here&#8217;s an&nbsp;example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>where it&#8217;s abundantly clear that <code>i32</code> is the type of variable <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Analogously above, you can see that
an unnamed symbol (<code>_</code>, the underscore) is declared to be of type <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>So in this alternate phrasing, <code>()</code> denotes a <em>type</em>.</p>
<h4>Let a pattern&nbsp;emerge</h4>
<p>What about the original form, <code>let () = ...</code>?
There is no explicit type declaration here (i.e. no colon),
and a pair of empty parentheses isn&#8217;t a name that could be assigned a new&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>What exactly is happening there,&nbsp;then?&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, it isn&#8217;t really anything special.
While it may look exceptional, and totally unlike common usages of <code>let</code>,
it is in fact exactly the same thing as a mundane <code>let x = 5</code>.
The potential misconception here is about the exact meaning of <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>The simple version is that it&#8217;s a name for the bound expression.<br>
But the actual truth is that it&#8217;s a <em>pattern</em> which is matched against that&nbsp;expression.</p>
<p>The terms &#8220;pattern&#8221; and &#8220;matching&#8221; here refer to the same mechanism
that occurrs within <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/match.html">the <code>match</code> statement</a>.
You could even imagine a peculiar form of desugaring,
where a <code>let</code> statement is converted into a semantically equivalent <code>match</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">original</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">desugared</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">match</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">match</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">            </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>This analogy works perfectly<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, because the patterns here are <em>irrefutable</em>:
any value can match them, as all we&#8217;re doing is giving the value a name.
Should the case be any different, Rust would reject our <code>let</code> statement &#8212;
just like it rejects a <code>match</code> block that doesn&#8217;t include branches for all possible&nbsp;outcomes.</p>
<h4>An empty&nbsp;pattern</h4>
<p>But just because a pattern has to always match the expression,
it doesn&#8217;t mean only simple identifiers like <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> are permitted in <code>let</code>.
If Rust is able to statically ensure a match,
it is perfectly <span class="caps">OK</span> to use a pattern with an internal structure<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Wrapping</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Wrapping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Wrapping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Of course, something like this is just superfluous and silly.
Same mechanism, however, is also behind the ability to &#8220;initialize multiple&nbsp;variables&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>What really happens is that we take a <em>tuple expression</em> <code>(0, 1)</code>
and match it against a pattern <code>(x, y)</code>.
Because it is trivially satisified,
we have the symbols <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> bound to the tuple elements.
For all intents and purposes, this is equivalent to having two separate <code>let</code> statements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Of course, a 2-tuple is not the only pattern of this kind we can use in <code>let</code>.
Others possible patterns include, for example, the <em>0-tuple</em>.</p>
<p>Or, as we express it in Rust, <code>()</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that&#8217;s a truly useless statement!
But it also harkens straight to our debug binding.
It should be pretty clear now how it&nbsp;works:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>()</code> stanza on the left is neither a type nor a name, but a <em>pattern</em>.</li>
<li>The expression on the right is being <em>matched</em> against this&nbsp;pattern.</li>
<li>Because the types of both of those things differ, the compiler signals an appropriate&nbsp;error.</li>
</ul>
<p>The curious thing is that there is nothing inherently magical about using <code>()</code> on the left hand side.
It&#8217;s simply the shortest pattern we can put after <code>let</code>.
It&#8217;s also one that&#8217;s extremely unlikely to actually match the right hand side,
which ensures we get the desired error.
But if you substituted something equally exotic and rare &#8212; say, <code>(x, ((y, z), Wrapping(w)))</code> &#8212;
it would work equally well as a rudimentary type&nbsp;detector.</p>
<p>Except for one thing, of course: nobody wants to type this much!
Borne out of this frugality (and/or laziness), a custom thus emerged to use <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>Short, sweet, and <em>clever</em>.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>A more formal, type-theoretic formulation of this fact
is saying that <code>()</code> is <em>inhabited</em> by only one value.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>In case you are wondering, one possible fix here is to <code>return 1i32;</code> inside the <code>if</code>.
An (arguably more idiomatic) alternative is to put <code>0i32</code> in an <code>else</code> branch,
turning the entire <code>if</code> construct into the last &#8212; and only &#8212; expression in the function body.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Note how each nested <code>match</code> is also introducing a new scope,
exactly like the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.10.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html#thinking-in-scopes">canonical desugaring</a>
of <code>let</code> which is often used to explain lifetimes and borrowing.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:4">
<p>Unfortunately, Rust isn&#8217;t currently capable of proving that the pattern is irrefutable in all obvious cases.
For example, <code>let Some(x) = Some(42);</code> will be rejected due to the existence of a <code>None</code> variant in <code>Option</code>,
even though it isn&#8217;t actually used in the (constant) expression on the right.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>For a unit test to be comprehensive,
it must often access some private symbols from the module it&nbsp;checks.</p>
<p>In Rust, this is permitted for submodules:
they can freely refer to anything defined &#8220;upwards&#8221; in the module hierarchy.
The only requirement is that they import it explicitly by name,
using statements such as <code>use super::foo</code>.</p>
<p>To illustrate this,

<p>The internal function, as shown above, can be imported and verified independently
of the <code>pub</code>lic one.
This is done through a <code>#[test]</code> procedure in an inline&nbsp;submodule.</p>
<p>Such factorization and granular testing is commonplace,
especially when the public <span class="caps">API</span> may cause unwanted side effects,
such as printing stuff to stdout&nbsp;here.</p>
<h4>The issue of&nbsp;length</h4>
<p>But if you are like me and prefer your modules to be short and sweet,
you may feel justifiably concerned about this <em>inline</em> submodule&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>In the toy example above,
tests have already taken at least as many lines as the actual code.
Real world usually <a href="https://github.com/Geal/nom/blob/80a1deab58d1faf41c05a5d741d9e3f51bde3a55/src/nom.rs#L599">matches</a> this ratio.
A module with a couple hundred lines of regular code starts
to be measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code#Related_terms">KLOCs</a>
if we also include its&nbsp;tests.</p>
<p>While this could be taken as a strong hint to split things up,
it can just as easily disincentivize testing&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to move those tests somewhere else.
What is not so evident is how to preserve this crucial module-submodule relation,
enabling us to write comprehensive tests in the first&nbsp;place.</p>
<h4>Looking for&nbsp;inspiration</h4>
<p>I must quickly disappoint anyone who would like to round up all their unit tests
and sequester them in some distant <em>tests/</em> directory.
Such layout is reserved for
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/testing.html#the-tests-directory">crate-level</a> (&#8220;integration&#8221;) tests.
Unit tests, on the other hand, are predestined to live among production code<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s at least relocate them to separate&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>To make this goal more concrete,
we will try to emulate the project layout described in
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#File_Names">Google&#8217;s C++ style guide</a>.
By this convention, a conceptual &#8220;module&#8221; or &#8220;unit&#8221; consists of the following&nbsp;files:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>foo.h</em></li>
<li><em>foo.cc</em></li>
<li><em>foo_test.cc</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Translating this to Rust, we&nbsp;get:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>foo.rs</em></li>
<li><em>foo_test.rs</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The first one is obviously our production code.
The second file, <em>foo_test.rs</em>,
contains all the tests we would previously put in the <code>mod tests { }</code> construct.</p>
<p>Seems pretty clean and straightforward, right?
Unfortunately, Rust will not accept this setup without some&nbsp;convincing.</p>
<h4>Family&nbsp;problems</h4>
<p>To understand why,
recall that the mere presence of some <em>.rs</em> files
is not enough for the Rust compiler to care.
If we want them picked up and included in the project,
we also need to add some <em>module declarations</em>&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>In other words, there must also be a <em>mod.rs</em> file in this directory,
containing at the very least the following&nbsp;content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// (mod.rs)</span>

<span class="kn">mod</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="cp">#[cfg(test)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kn">mod</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">foo_test</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now it should be clearer that something is&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>We got two modules here, but they are <em>siblings</em>.
Both <code>foo</code> and <code>foo_test</code> are on the same level,
children of whatever parent module contains them both.
More to the point, it&#8217;s <code>foo_test</code> that&#8217;s not a child module of <code>foo</code>,
meaning it can only see the <code>pub</code>lic symbols of the&nbsp;latter.</p>
<p>This is not quite enough to write a proper unit test.
It definitely isn&#8217;t for our initial FizzBuzz example,
because the <code>fizzbuzz_string</code> function cannot even be&nbsp;imported!</p>
<h4>Existential&nbsp;crises</h4>
<p>Okay, so how about we move the <code>mod foo_test;</code> declaration to <em>foo.rs</em>?
This should be enough to establish the proper hierarchy.
After all, this is how the module tree is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/crates-and-modules.html#defining-modules">normally reconstructed</a>:
from the appropriate placement of the <code>mod</code> statements.</p>
<p>So, here we&nbsp;go:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// (foo.rs)</span>

<span class="cp">#[cfg(test)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kn">mod</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">foo_test</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre>error: cannot declare a new module at this location
  --&gt; src/parent/foo.rs:4:5
   |
 4 | mod foo_test;
</pre></div>


<p>&#8230;Really?</p>
<p>Well, yes. A declaration like this simply isn&#8217;t allowed.
The reason for this is actually much less arbitrary than the error message would&nbsp;indicate.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, <code>foo_test</code> simply cannot <em>exist</em> if it&#8217;s introduced there.
To deliver on its declaration promise,
the submodule would have to reside <em>within <code>foo</code> itself</em>.
But of course, <em>foo.rs</em> is just a file, so this setup is evidently&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<p>All in all, Rust seems to be looking for our module in all the wrong&nbsp;places.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can just <em>tell it</em> where it should be going&nbsp;instead?&#8230;</p>
<h4>The right&nbsp;path</h4>
<p>Enter the <code>#[path]</code> attribute,
which fulfills this exact&nbsp;purpose:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// (foo.rs)</span>

<span class="cp">#[cfg(test)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="cp">#[path = </span><span class="s">&quot;./foo_test.rs&quot;</span><span class="cp">]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kn">mod</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">foo_test</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>#[path]</code> tells the Rust compiler where to look for the <code>mod</code>ule it is attached to.
Its argument is relative to the location of the outer module (like <code>foo</code> here),
and can be either a single file, or a directory with <em>mod.rs</em>.</p>
<p>Conceptually, this is similar to a custom <code>ClassLoader</code> in Java,
or the common <a href="http://xion.org.pl/2012/05/06/hacking-python-imports/"><code>sys.path</code> hacks</a> in Python.
Unlike those two languages, however,
the <code>#[path]</code> attribute is only relevant at compile&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Additionally, and somewhat <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/13156">confusingly</a>,
<code>#[path]</code> can also be applied <em>retroactively</em>
to a module that the compiler has already located.
In such case, it will affect <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#modules">the lookup of any child modules</a>
by making <code>rustc</code> search for them in the new&nbsp;location.</p>
<hr />
<p>With <code>#[path]</code> handy,
it is therefore possible to implement custom layouts
of regular source modules and test&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>But like with every tool that can be used to defy conventions,
it should be used with the appropriate care.
While a straightforward and self-documenting approach described here
is unlikely to raise any eyebrows,
rewriting module paths willy-nilly is most certainly a bad&nbsp;idea.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://xion.io/post/code/python-all-wild-imports.html#python-all-wild-imports">__all__ and wild imports in&nbsp;Python</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Mon 26 December 2016 in <a href="http://xion.io/category/code.html">Code</a>
      &#8226; Tagged with
      <a href="http://xion.io/tag/python.html">Python</a>,      <a href="http://xion.io/tag/modules.html">modules</a>,      <a href="http://xion.io/tag/imports.html">imports</a>,      <a href="http://xion.io/tag/testing.html">testing</a>      &#8226; <a href="http://xion.io/post/code/python-all-wild-imports.html#disqus_thread">Leave a comment</a>

  <div>
      <p>An often misunderstood piece of Python import machinery is the <code>__all__</code> attribute.
While it is completely <em>optional</em>,
it&#8217;s common to see modules with the <code>__all__</code> list populated&nbsp;explicitly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">__all__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;Foo&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c"># ...</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">bar</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c"># ...</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">baz</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c"># ...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before explaining what the real purpose of <code>__all__</code> is
(and how it relates to the titular wild imports),
let&#8217;s deconstruct some common misconceptions by highlighting what it <em>isn&#8217;t</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>__all__</code> doesn&#8217;t prevent any of the module symbols (functions, classes, etc.)
from being <em>directly</em> imported.
In our the example, the seemingly omitted <code>baz</code> function (which is not included in <code>__all__</code>),
is still <em>perfectly importable</em> by writing <code>from module import baz</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, <code>__all__</code> doesn&#8217;t influence what symbols are included in the results of
<code>dir(module)</code> or <code>vars(module)</code>. So in the case above, a <code>dir</code> call would result in a
<code>['Foo', 'bar', 'baz']</code> list, even though <code>'baz'</code> does not occur in <code>__all__</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the content of <code>__all__</code> is more of a convention
rather than a strict limitation.
Regardless of what you put there, every symbol defined in your module
will still be accessible from the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>This is a clear reflection of the common policy in Python:
assume <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2003-October/025932.html">everyone is a consenting adult</a>,
and that visibility controls are not necessary.
Without an explicit <code>__all__</code> list,
Python simply puts all of the module &#8220;public&#8221; symbols there anyway<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>The meaning of it <code>__all__</code></h4>
<p>So, what does <code>__all__</code> actually&nbsp;effect?</p>
<p>This is neatly summed up in this brief
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2187636/434799">StackOverflow answer</a>.
Simply speaking, its purpose is&nbsp;twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It tells the readers of the source code &#8212; be it humans or automated tools &#8212;
what&#8217;s the conventional <em>public <span class="caps">API</span></em> exposed by the&nbsp;module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It lists names to import when performing the so-called <em>wild import</em>:
<code>from module import *</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the default content of <code>__all__</code> that I mentioned earlier,
the public <span class="caps">API</span> of a module can also be defined implicitly.
Some style guides (like the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Google one</a>)
are therefore relying on the <code>public</code> and <code>_private</code> naming exclusively.
Nevertheless, an explicit <code>__all__</code> list is still a perfectly valid option,
especially considering that no approach offers any form of <em>actual</em> access&nbsp;control.</p>
<h4>Import&nbsp;star</h4>
<p>The second point, however, has some real runtime&nbsp;significance.</p>
<p>In Python, like in many other languages,
it is recommended to be explicit about the exact functions and classes we&#8217;re importing.
Commonly, the <code>import</code> statement will thus take one of the following&nbsp;forms:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">random</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">urllib.parse</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">random</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">randint</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">logging</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">fatal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">warning</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">warn</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">urllib.parse</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">urlparse</span>
<span class="c"># etc.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In each case, it&#8217;s easy to see the relevant <em>name</em> being imported.
Regardless of the exact syntax and the possible presence of aliasing (<code>as</code>),
it&#8217;s always the last (qualified) name in the <code>import</code> statement,
before a newline or&nbsp;comma.</p>
<p>Contrast this with an <code>import</code> that ends with an&nbsp;asterisk:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">itertools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is called a <em>star</em> or <em>wild import</em>, and it isn&#8217;t so straightforward.
This is also the reason why using it is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3615206/434799">generally discouraged</a>,
except for some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3615238/434799">very specific situations</a>.</p>
<p>Why? Because you cannot easily see what exact names are being imported here.
For that you&#8217;d have to go to the module&#8217;s source and &#8212; you guessed it &#8212;
look at the <code>__all__</code> list<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Taming the&nbsp;wild</h4>
<p>Barring some less important details,
the mechanics of <code>import *</code> could therefore be expressed in the following Python&nbsp;(pseudo)code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">module</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">__temp</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">__name</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">module</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nb">globals</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">getattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__temp</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">__name</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">__temp</span>
<span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">__name</span>
</pre></div>


<p>One interesting case to consider is
what happens when <code>__all__</code> contains a <em>wrong</em>&nbsp;name.</p>
<p>What if one of the strings there doesn&#8217;t correspond to any name within the&nbsp;module?&#8230;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># foo.py</span>
<span class="n">__all__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;Foo&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">bar</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">foo</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">foo</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>
<span class="n">Traceback</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">most</span> <span class="n">recent</span> <span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">File</span> <span class="s">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="ne">AttributeError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;module&#39;</span> <span class="nb">object</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="n">no</span> <span class="n">attribute</span> <span class="s">&#39;Foo&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Quite predictably, <code>import *</code> blows up.<br>
Notice, however, that regular import <em>still works</em>.<br></p>
<p>All in all (ahem), this hints at a cute little trick which is also very&nbsp;self-evident:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">__all__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;DO_NOT_WILD_IMPORT&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Put this in a Python module, and no one will be able to <code>import *</code> from it!<br>
Much more effective than any lint warning ;-)<br></p>
<h4>Test <code>__all__</code> the&nbsp;things</h4>
<p>Jokes aside, this phenomenon (<code>__all__</code> with an out-of-place name in it) can also backfire.
Especially when
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/callee/blob/277add8170bd0c758f3c4a3068127e8229d2e2d1/callee/__init__.py#L31">reexporting</a>,
it&#8217;s relatively easy to introduce stray <code>'name'</code> into <code>__all__</code>:
one which doesn&#8217;t correspond to any <code>name</code> that&#8217;s <em>actually present</em> in the&nbsp;namespace.</p>
<p>If we commit such a mishap, we are inadvertently lying about the public <span class="caps">API</span> of our package.
What&#8217;s worse is that this mistake can propagate through documentation generators,
and ultimately mislead our&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>While some linters may be able to catch this,
a <a href="https://github.com/Xion/callee/blob/277add8170bd0c758f3c4a3068127e8229d2e2d1/tests/test_all.py#L10">simple test</a>
like this&nbsp;one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Test that __all__ contains only names that are actually exported.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">yourpackage</span>

    <span class="n">missing</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">yourpackage</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__all__</span>
                  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">getattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">yourpackage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEmpty</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">missing</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">msg</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;__all__ contains unresolved names: </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="s">&quot;, &quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">missing</span><span class="p">),))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>is a quick <span class="amp">&amp;</span> easy way to ensure this never&nbsp;happens.</p>
<div class="footnote">

<li id="fn:1">
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Public&#8221; symbols have names that don&#8217;t begin with underscore (<code>_</code>).
Of course, &#8220;non-public&#8221; ones are still accessible
but are treated as implicitly unstable <span class="amp">&amp;</span> discouraged.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
