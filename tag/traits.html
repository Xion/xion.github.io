      <p><em>&#8230;or how I learned to stop worrying and love the borrow&nbsp;checker.</em></p>
<p>Having no equivalents in other languages, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html">borrow checker</a>
is arguably the most difficult thing to come to terms with when learning Rust. It&#8217;s easy to understand why it&#8217;s immensely
useful, especially if you recall
<a href="https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2016/02/cve-2015-7547-glibc-getaddrinfo-stack.html">the various vulnerabities</a>
stemming from memory mismanagement. But that knowledge doesn&#8217;t exactly help when the compiler is whining about what
seems like a perfectly correct&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: it will take some time to become productive writing efficient and safe code. It&#8217;s not entirely unlike
adjusting to a different paradigm such as functional programming when you&#8217;ve been writing mostly imperative code.
Before that happens, though, you can use some tricks to make the transition a little&nbsp;easier.</p>
<h4>Just <code>clone</code> it</h4>
<p>Ideally, we&#8217;d want our code to be both correct <em>and</em> fast. But if we cannot quite get to the &#8220;correctness&#8221; part yet &#8212;
because our program doesn&#8217;t, you know, <em>compile</em> &#8212; then how about paying for it with a small (and refundable)
performance&nbsp;hit?</p>
<p>This is where the <code>clone</code> method comes in handy. Many problems with the borrow checker stem from trying to spread
object ownership too thin. It is a precious resource and it&#8217;s not very cheap to &#8220;produce&#8221;, which is why good Rust code
often deals with just immutable or mutable&nbsp;references.</p>
<p>But if that proves difficult, then &#8220;making more objects&#8221; is a great intermediate solution. Incidentally, this is what
higher level languages are doing all the time, and often transparently. To ease the transition to Rust from
those languages, we can start off by replicating their&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a function that tries to convert some value to <code>String</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">maybe_to_string</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// omitted</span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>If we attempt to build upon it and create a <code>Vec</code>tor&nbsp;version:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">maybe_all_to_string</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">results</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">maybe_to_string</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Some</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">res</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">is_err</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Err</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">Ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>then we&#8217;ll be unpleasantly surprised by a borrow checker&nbsp;error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>error: cannot move out of borrowed content [E0507]
    Ok(results.iter().map(|r| r.ok().unwrap()).collect())
                              ^
</pre></div>


<p>Much head scratching will ensue, and we may eventually find an idiomatic and efficient solution.
However, a simple stepping stone in the shape of additional <code>clone()</code> call can help move things forward just
a little&nbsp;quicker:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#[derive(Clone)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="nb">Ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">clone</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>The performance tradeoff is explicit, and easy to find later on with a simple <code>grep clone\(\)</code> or similar.
When you learn to do things the Rusty way, it won&#8217;t be hard to go back to your &#8220;hack&#8221; and fix it&nbsp;properly.</p>
<h4>Refcounting to the&nbsp;rescue</h4>
<p>Adding <code>clone()</code> willy-nilly to make the code compile is a valid workaround when we&#8217;re just learning. Sometimes, however,
even some gratuitous cloning doesn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> solve the problem, because the <code>clone()</code> itself can become an&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>For one, it requires our objects to implement the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html"><code>Clone</code> trait</a>.
This was apparent even in our previous example, since we had to add a <code>#[derive(Clone)]</code> attribute to the <code>struct Error</code>
in order to make it <code>clone</code>-able.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the vast majority of cases this will be all that&#8217;s necessary, as most built-in types in Rust implement
<code>Clone</code> already. One notable exception are <em>function traits</em> (<code>FnOnce</code>, <code>Fn</code>, and <code>FnMut</code>) which are used to store
and refer to <em>closures</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Structures and other custom types that contain them (or those which <em>may</em> contain them)
cannot therefore implement <code>Clone</code> through a simple <code>#[derive]</code> annotation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c-Doc">/// A value that&#39;s either there already</span>
<span class="c-Doc">/// or can be obtained by calling a function.</span>
<span class="cp">#[derive(Clone)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">enum</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">LazyValue</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Clone</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Immediate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Deferred</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Fn</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre>error: the trait `core::marker::Sized` is not implemented for the type `core::ops::Fn() -&gt; T + &#39;static` [E0277]
    #[derive(Clone)]
             ^~~~~
</pre></div>


<p>What can we do in this case, then? Well, there is yet another kind of performance concessions we can make,
and this one will likely sound familiar if you&#8217;ve ever worked with a higher level language before. Instead of actually
cloning an object, you can merely increment its <em>reference counter</em>. As the most rudimentary kind of garbage collection,
this allows to safely share the object between multiple &#8220;owners&#8221;, where each can behave as if it had
its own copy of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Rust&#8217;s pointer type that provides reference counting capabilities is called <code>std::rc::Rc</code>. Conceptually, it is analogous
to <code>std::shared_ptr</code> from C++, and it similarly keeps the refcount updated when the pointer is &#8220;acquired&#8221; (<code>clone</code>-ed)
and &#8220;released&#8221; (<code>drop</code>-ed). Because no data is moved around during either of those two operations, <code>Rc</code> can refer even
to types whose size isn&#8217;t known at compilation time, like abstract&nbsp;closures:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">rc</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Rc</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="cp">#[derive(Clone)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">enum</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">LazyValue</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Clone</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Immediate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Deferred</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Rc</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Fn</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Wrapping them in <code>Rc</code> therefore makes them &#8220;cloneable&#8221;. They aren&#8217;t actually cloned, of course, but because of
the inherent immutability of Rust types they will appear so to any outside observer<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Move&nbsp;it!</h4>
<p>Ultimately, most problems with the borrow checker boil down to unskillful mixing of the two ways you handle data in Rust.
There is <em>ownership</em>, which is passed around by moving the values; and there is <em>borrowing</em>, which means operating
on them through&nbsp;references.</p>
<p>When you try to switch from one to the other, some friction is bound to occur. Code that uses references, for example,
has to be copiously sprinkled with <code>&amp;</code> and <code>&amp;mut</code>, and may sometimes require explicit lifetime annotations. All these
have to be added or removed, and changes like that tend to propagate quite readily to the upper layers
of the program&#8217;s&nbsp;logic.</p>
<p>Therefore it is generally preferable, if at all possible, to deal with data directly
and not through references. To maintain efficiency, however, we need to learn how to move the objects through the various
stages of our algorithms. It turns out it&#8217;s surprisingly easy to inadvertently borrow something, hindering the possibility
of producing a moved&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>Take our first example. The intuitively named <code>Vec::iter</code> method produces an iterator that we can <code>map</code> over, but does
it really go over the actual <em>items</em> in the vector? Nope! It gives us a <em>reference</em> to each one &#8212; a borrow, if you will
&#8212; which is exactly why we originally had to use <code>clone</code> to get out of this&nbsp;bind.</p>
<p>Instead, why not just get the elements themselves, by moving them out of the vector? <code>Vec::into_iter</code> allows to do exactly&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">Ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">results</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">into_iter</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">unwrap</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="n">collect</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>and enables us to remove the <code>clone()</code> call. The family of similar <code>into_X</code> (or even just <code>into</code>) methods can be reliably counted
on at least in the standard library. They are also part of a more-or-less official
<a href="https://aturon.github.io/style/naming.html#conversions">naming convention</a> that you should also follow in your own&nbsp;code.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Note how this is different from function <em>types</em>, i.e. <code>fn(A, B, C, ...) -&gt; Ret</code>. It is because plain functions
do not carry their closure environments along with them. This makes them little more than just pointers to some code,
and those can be freely <code>Clone</code>-d (or even <code>Copy</code>-ed).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div>
      <p>Having recently been writing some C++ code at work, I had once again experienced the kind of exasperation that this
cumbersome language evokes on regular basis. When I was working in it less sporadically, I was shrugging it off
and telling myself it&#8217;s all because of the low level it operates on. Superior performance was the other side of the deal,
and it was supposed to make all the trade-offs&nbsp;worthwhile.</p>
<p>Now, however, I realized that running close to the metal by no means excuses the sort of clunkiness that C++ permits.
For example, there really is no reason why the archaically asinine separation of header <span class="amp">&amp;</span> source files &#8212;
with its inevitable redundancy of declarations and definitions, worked around with Java-esque contraptions such as
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PimplIdiom">pimpl</a> &#8212; is still the bread and butter of C++ programs.<br/>
Same goes for the lack of sane dependency management, or a universal, portable build system. None of those would be
at odds with native compilation to machine code, or runtime speeds that are adequate for real-time&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>Rather than dwelling on those gripes, I thought it&#8217;d be more productive to look around and see what&#8217;s
the modern offerring in the domain of lower level, <em>really</em> fast languages. The search wasn&#8217;t long at all, because
right now it seems there is just one viable contender: Rust<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Rusty&nbsp;systems</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> introduces itself as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language">&#8220;systems programming language&#8221;</a>, which is quite a bold claim.
What followed the last time this phrase has been applied to an emerging language &#8212; Go &#8212; was a kind of
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Of-the-emerging-systems-languages-Rust-D-Go-and-Nim-which-is-the-strongest-language-and-why">word twisting</a>
that&#8217;s more indicative of politics, not computer&nbsp;science.</p>
<p>But Rust&#8217;s pretense to the system level is well justified. It clearly provides the requisite toolkit for working
directly with the hardware, be it <a href="https://github.com/miselin/rustic">embedded controllers</a> or
<a href="http://www.redox-os.org/">fully featured computers</a>. It offers compilation to native machine code;
direct memory access; running time guarantees thanks to the lack of <span class="caps">GC</span>-incuded stops;
and great interoperability through static and dynamic&nbsp;linkage.</p>
<p>In short, with Rust you can wreak havoc against the <span class="caps">RAM</span> and twiddle bits to your heart&#8217;s&nbsp;content.</p>
<h4>Safe and&nbsp;sound</h4>
<p>To be fair, though, the &#8220;havoc&#8221; part is not entirely accurate. Despite its focus on the low level, efficient computing,
Rust aims to be a very safe language. Unlike C, it actively tries to prevent the programmer from shooting themselves
in the foot &#8212; though it will hand you the gun if you but ask for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The safety guarantees provided by Rust apply to resource management, with the specific emphasis on memory
and pointers to it. The way that most contemporary languages deal with memory is by introducing a <em>garbage collector</em>
which mostly (though not wholly) relieves the programmer from thinking about allocations and deallocations.
However, the kind of global, stop-the-world garbage collections
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Na.C3.AFve_mark-and-sweep">mark-and-sweep</a>)
is costly and unpredictable, ruling it out as a mechanism for real-time&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>For this reason, Rust doesn&#8217;t mandate a <span class="caps">GC</span> of this kind<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. And although it offers mechanisms that are similar to
smart pointers from C++ (e.g. <code>std::shared_ptr</code>), it is actually preferable and <em>safer</em> to use regular, &#8220;naked&#8221; pointers:
<code>&amp;Foo</code> versus <code>Cell&lt;Foo&gt;</code> or <code>RefCell&lt;Foo&gt;</code> (which are some of the Rust&#8217;s &#8220;smart pointer&#8221;&nbsp;types).</p>
<p>The trick is in the clever compiler. As long as we use regular pointers, it is capable of detecting potential memory
bugs at <em>compilation time</em>. They are referred to as &#8220;data races&#8221; in Rust&#8217;s terminology, and include
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/references-and-borrowing.html#issues-borrowing-prevents">perennial problems</a>
that will segfault any C code which wasn&#8217;t written with utmost&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>Part of those safety guarantees is also the <em>default immutability</em> of references (pointers). The simplest reference
of type <code>&amp;Foo</code> in Rust translates to something like <code>const Foo * const</code> in C<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. You have to explicitly request
mutability with the <code>mut</code> keyword, and Rust ensures there is always at most one mutable reference to any value,
thus preventing problems caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_aliasing">pointer aliasing</a>.</p>
<p>But what if you really must sling raw pointers, and access arbitrary memory locations? Maybe you are programming
a microcontroller where I/O is done through a special memory region. For those occasions, Rust has got you covered
with the <code>unsafe</code> keyword:</p>

<p>Its usage, like in the above example, can be <em>very</em> localized, limited only to those places where it&#8217;s truly necessary
and guarded by the appropriate checks. As a result, the interface exposed by the above function
can be considered safe. The unrestricted memory access can be contained to where it&#8217;s really&nbsp;inevitable.</p>
<h4>Typing&nbsp;counts</h4>
<p>Ensuring memory safety is not the only way in which Rust differentiates itself from C.
What separates those two languages is also a few decades of practice and research into programming semantics.
It&#8217;s only natural to expect Rust to take advantage of this&nbsp;progress.</p>
<p>And advantage it takes. Although Rust&#8217;s type system isn&#8217;t nearly as advanced and complex like &#8212; say &#8212; Scala&#8217;s,
it exhibits several interesting properties that are indicative of its relatively modern&nbsp;origin.</p>
<p>First, it mixes the two most popular programming paradigms &#8212; functional and object-oriented &#8212; in roughly equal
concentrations, as opposed to being biased towards the latter. Rust doesn&#8217;t have interfaces or classes: it has <em>traits</em>
and their <em>implementations</em>. Even though they often fulfill similar purposes of abstraction and encapsulation,
these constructs are closer to the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class">type classes</a>
and their instances, which are found for example in&nbsp;Haskell.</p>
<p>Still, the more familiar notions of <span class="caps">OOP</span> aren&#8217;t too far off. Most of the key functionality of classes, for example,
can be simulated by implementing &#8220;default&#8221; traits for user-defined&nbsp;types:</p>

<p>The second aspect of Rust&#8217;s type system that we would come to expect from a new language is its expressive power.
<em>Type inference</em> is nowadays a staple, and above we can observe the simplest form of it. But it extends further,
to generic parameters, closure arguments, and closure return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>Generics, by the way, are quite nice as well. Besides their applicability to structs, type aliases, functions,
traits, trait implementations, etc., they allow for constraining their arguments with traits. This is similar to
the abandoned-and-not-quite-revived-yet idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_%28C%2B%2B%29">concepts in C++</a>,
or to an analogous mechanism from&nbsp;C#.</p>
<p>The third common trend in contemporary language design is the use of type system to solve common tasks.
Rust doesn&#8217;t go full Haskell and opt for monads for everything, but its <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> types are evidently
the functional approach to error handling<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. To facilitate their use, a powerful
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/patterns.html"><em>pattern matching</em> facility</a> is also present in&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<h4>Unexpectedly&nbsp;pythonic</h4>
<p>If your general go-to language is Python, you will find Rust a very nice complement and possibly a valuable instrument
in your coding arsenal. Interoperability between Python and Rust is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/rust-inside-other-languages.html#python">stupidly easy</a>,
thanks to both the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/ctypes.html"><code>ctypes</code> module</a> and the extreme simplicity
of creating portable,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/rust-inside-other-languages.html#a-rust-library">shared libraries</a> in Rust.
Offloading some expensive, <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock"><span class="caps">GIL</span></a>-bypassing computation to a fast,
native code written in Rust can thus be a relatively painless way of speeding up crucial parts of a Python&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>But somewhat more surprisingly, Rust has quite a few bits that seem to be directly inspired by Python semantics.
Granted, those two languages are conceptually pretty far apart in general, but the analogies are&nbsp;there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/iterators.html">iterators</a> in Rust is very similar to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-iterable">iterables</a> in Python. Even the <code>for</code> loop is basically identical:
rather than manually increment a counter, both in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/loops.html#for">Rust</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop">Python</a> you iterate over a <em>range of numbers</em>.<br/>
Oh, and both languages have an <code>enumerate</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/loops.html#enumerate">method</a>/
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate">function</a> that yields pairs of <code>(index, element)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/method-syntax.html#method-calls">method definition</a>
in Rust uses the <code>self</code> keyword as first argument to distinguish between instance methods and &#8220;class&#8221;/&#8221;static&#8221; methods
(or <em>associated functions</em> in Rust&#8217;s parlance).
This is even more pythonic than in actual Python, where <code>self</code> is technically just a convention,
albeit an extremely strong&nbsp;one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In either language, overloading operators doesn&#8217;t use any new keywords or special syntax,
like it does in C++, C#, and others. Python accomplishes it through <code>__magic__</code> methods, whereas Rust
has very similarly named <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/operators-and-overloading.html">operator traits</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust basically <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/documentation.html#documentation-as-tests">has <code>doctest</code></a>.
If you don&#8217;t know, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html"><code>doctest</code> module</a> is a standard Python testing
utility that can run usage examples found in documentation comments and verify their correctness. Rust version (<code>rustdoc</code>)
is even more powerful and flexible, allowing for example to mark additional boilerplate lines that should be run
when testing examples, but <em>not</em> included in the generated&nbsp;documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the list doesn&#8217;t end here and will grow over time. As of this writing, for example, nightly builds of Rust
already offer <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/slice-patterns.html">advanced slice pattern matching</a> which are
very similar to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/">extended iterable unpacking</a> from Python&nbsp;3.</p>
<h4>Is it worth&nbsp;it?</h4>
<p>Depending on your background and the programming domain you are working in, you may be wondering if Rust
is a language that&#8217;s worth looking into now, or in the near&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Firstly, let me emphasize that it&#8217;s still in its early stages. Although the stable version 1.0 has been released
<a href="http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html">a good couple of months ago</a>, the ecosystem isn&#8217;t nearly as diverse
and abundant as in some of the other new&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>If you are specifically looking to deploying Rust-written <span class="caps">API</span> servers, backends, and other &#8212; shall I use the word
&#8212; microservices, then right now you&#8217;ll probably be better served by more established solutions,
like Java with <a href="http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/">fibers</a>, asynchronous Python on PyPy, Erlang,
Go, node.js, or similar.
I predict Rust catching up here in the coming months, though, because the prospect of writing native speed <span class="caps">JSON</span> slingers
with relative ease is just too compelling to&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>The other interesting area for Rust is <em>game programming</em>, because it&#8217;s one of the few languages capable of supporting
even the most demanding <span class="caps">AAA</span>+ productions. The good news is that portable, open source
<a href="http://www.piston.rs/">game engines</a> are already here. The bad news is that most of the existing knowledge
about designing and coding high performance games is geared towards writing (stripped down) C++. The community
is also rather <del>stubborn</del> reluctant to adopt anything that may carry even a <em>hint</em> of potentially unknown
performance implications. Although some inroads have been made (here&#8217;s, for example,
an <a href="https://github.com/HeroesGrave/ecs-rs">entity component system</a> written in Rust), and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
to see indie games written in Rust, it probably won&#8217;t take over the industry anytime&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware, though, Rust may already have the upper hand. It is obviously much easier language to program in
than pure C. Along with its toolchain&#8217;s ability to produce
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/no-stdlib.html">minimal executables</a>, it makes for a compelling language for
programming microcontrollers and other embedded&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>So in short, Rust is pretty nice. And if you have read that far, I think you should just go ahead
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">have a look</a> for yourself&nbsp;:)</p>
