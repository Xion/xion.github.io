  <div>
      <p>Just like many other people, I was following news from the last week&#8217;s
<a href="https://build.microsoft.com/"><span class="caps">BUILD</span> conference</a> with piqued interest. The ability to run Linux userland programs
on Windows &#8212; including, of course,
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/be-very-afraid-hell-has-frozen-over-bash-is-coming-to-windows-10/">bash</a> &#8212;
is something to be excited about. If nothing else, it should dramatically improve Windows support of new programming
languages that seem to pop up all the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>There was something else, however, that I couldn&#8217;t help but notice. The reactions of tech communities to this and similar developments focused very frequently on Microsoft&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>The beloved &#8220;new Microsoft&#8221;,
as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4cqm9y/xamarin_becomes_free_and_opensource/d1kjwl8">some call it</a>,
embraces open source, supports Linux, and generally does almost a full 180 with their stance on
proprietary vs. free software. The circumstances fit this narrative rather snuggly, too: a new <span class="caps">CEO</span> makes a clean break
with the past to pivot the company in this new world ruled by mobile and&nbsp;cloud.</p>
<p>Still&#8230; <em>love</em>? Even considering how Internet comments are grotesquely exaggerated most of the time, that&#8217;s quite
a declaration. The sentiment is nowhere near isolated either. But it&#8217;s not a question whether this infatuation
has a rational merit, or whether those feelings will eventually turn out to be&nbsp;misplaced.</p>
<p>The question is: why does it exist at all? We are talking about a <em>company</em> here, a for-profit organization.
How can such a language even enter the&nbsp;picture?</p>
<p>Then I realized this is not really a new phenomenon. Quite the opposite: the broad developer community seems to
always need a company to champion its core values. Nowadays, we&#8217;re simply trying to find someone new
to carry the&nbsp;standard.</p>
<p>Why? Because we feel that our old heroes have forsaken&nbsp;us.</p>
<h4>Hall of past&nbsp;fame</h4>
<p>Take <strong>GitHub</strong> for example. Once a darling of the open source community, it&#8217;s been suffering sharp criticism
for many months now. Rightfully or not, many people aren&#8217;t exactly excited &#8212; to put it mildly &#8212; about changes to
the <a href="https://github.com/blog/2146-organizations-can-now-block-abusive-users">policy</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/blog/2039-adopting-the-open-code-of-conduct">atmosphere</a> at GitHub,
typified by the ill-fated <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/githubs-ceo-ditches-meritocracy-rug-2014-1">meritocracy rug</a>.
The widely backed and long standing <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github">plea for a few critical features</a>
has only recently stopped falling on deaf ears. And in the background, there are always concerns about GitHub simply
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10823128">becoming too big</a>, and exterting too much control over
the open source&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Nota bene</em>, the very same ecosystem it had once been lauded for&nbsp;nurturing.</p>
<p>Among the other flagship tech companies, <strong>Apple</strong> or <strong>Facebook</strong> have never garnered much good will. Sure, they are
recognized for the pure utilitarian value of hardware they produce; or convenience, broad applicability, and stability
of APIs they offer. Facebook may be scoring some additional points for trying to
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">sort out</a> the mess of frontend development, but many say it&#8217;s
<a href="https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.j740brod8">not doing anybody any favors</a>.
Neither company is easy to portray as a paragon of openness, though, and it&#8217;s probably easier to argue
<a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/apples-closed-ecosystem-threatening-derail-technological-revolution-1535944">the exact opposite</a>.</p>
<p>And then there is <strong>Google</strong>, of course<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Some time in the past few years, a palpable shift occurred in how
the company is perceived by the techie crowd. It&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint the exact pivotal moment, and the
<a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">one event that leaps to attention</a>
doesn&#8217;t seem sufficient to explain it. But the tone has been set,
allowing <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html">news</a> to be
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2yt73v/google_to_close_google_code_open_source_project/cpdb6xs">molded</a>
to fit it. Add this to the usual backdrop of complaints about the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ll864/my_horrible_google_interview_experience/">onerous</a>
interview process and general fearmongering, and the picture doesn&#8217;t look very&nbsp;bright.</p>
<h4>Shades of&nbsp;grey</h4>
<p>No similar woes seem to have been plaguing Microsoft as of late, even though their record of recent &#8220;unwholesome&#8221; deeds
isn&#8217;t exactly
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2447177/updategate-windows-10-is-resetting-default-apps-back-to-microsoft-stock">clean</a>
either. Does it mean they are indeed the most fitting candidate for a (new) enterprise ally of the hacker&nbsp;community?&#8230;</p>
<p>Or maybe we can finally recognize the whole notion as the utterly silly concept it actually is. Hard to shake though
it be, this quasi-Manicheic mentality of assigning labels of virtue or sin is, at best, a naive idealism. At worst,
it&#8217;s a peculiar kind of harmful partisanship that technologists are particularly susceptible to. You may recognize it
as something that has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">very long tradition</a> in the hacker&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a tradition worth&nbsp;keeping.</p>

      <p>If you look at discussion forums for people in the <span class="caps">CS</span> industry &#8212;
like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/">/r/cscareequestions</a> or even just Hacker News &#8212;
you&#8217;ll find lots of talk about the so called <em>Big Four</em>&nbsp;companies.</p>
<p>This is mostly in the context of applying to them, or going through their interview process.
Which of the large software corporations are discussed here tends to fluctuate a little bit,
but both Google and Microsoft are invariably included, with Facebook popping up more often than&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Because of their privileged positions as very desirable places to work, these companies tend to be taken as models
for others to mimic<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Probably the most apparent and direct outcome is the increasing prevalence of
&#8220;Google-style&#8221; interviews, which are now utilized by countless software shops around the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p><em>Whiteboard coding</em> is how they are often called. It is a subject of an intense debate, whether or not they &#8220;work&#8221;,
and adequately assess the engineering aptitude of candidates. If some
<a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768">high profile anecdotes</a> are of any indication, the most common complaint
is that they fail to recognize competence by ignoring previous professional work, open source contributions,
conference talks, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Instead, the whiteboard interview requires demand showing a &#8220;pure&#8221; problem solving ability
within a relatively short time window, all without some broader context or even the usual tools of the trade:
laptop, editor, and a search&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>As a Googler who had gone through this process and has now conducted a few of those interviews himself,
I find those complaints mostly valid albeit&nbsp;misdirected.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t really that Google interviews like it&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really the issue is <em>other companies</em> implementing the same process, and not realizing it cannot possibly work for&nbsp;them.</p>
<h4>Somewhat&nbsp;special</h4>
<p>It is important to understand that Google&#8217;s stance on interviewing is influenced by some unique&nbsp;circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>very high and steady influx of potential&nbsp;candidates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comparatively long tenure of the average engineer and the general focus on employee&nbsp;retention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>huge and mostly proprietary software stack working at a scale that almost no others&nbsp;do</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From this perspective, it makes sense to utilize cautious hiring strategies that may result in a high ratio
of <em>false negatives</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. When rejections are cheap but the new hires are supposed to be here for the long run &#8212;
partially because of the long ramp-up time necessary to become productive &#8212; it can be costly to give candidates
the benefit of the&nbsp;doubt.</p>
<p>The last point also explains why proficiency with specific technologies is less useful than
general flexibility grounded in strong fundamentals. To put it shortly, Google prefers you know
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"><span class="caps">CS</span></a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, whiteboard coding is just one input to the evaluation process, but it tends to be the most trustworthy one.
Besides programming aptitude, the ideal candidate would show a proven track record of technical leadership while
tackling complex problems that span a broad scope.<br>
Unfortunately, those qualities are difficult to convey <em>efficiently</em> and <em>reliably</em> through the usual industry channels:
a resume, references from previous jobs, GitHub profile,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<h4>Different&nbsp;conditions</h4>
<p>Given the above reasoning as to why &#8220;Google-style&#8221; interviews seem to work well for Google, I hope it&#8217;s evident why
they are likely a poor choice for companies that don&#8217;t share the same characteristics as the Big&nbsp;4.</p>
<p>For one, it is highly unusual for a software shop in today&#8217;s market to command a sizeable pool for qualified candidates.
Software engineering vacancies often go unfilled for weeks and months, even if the company isn&#8217;t exactly looking
for &#8220;rockstars&#8221;, &#8220;ninjas&#8221;, &#8220;gunslingers&#8221;, or whatever the silly term <em>du jour</em> is. Those who meet the requirements
usually have their pick at many different offers,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>The reality for many companies (especially startups) is also one where they are unable or unwilling to invest much
in the retention of their employees. Because the employment relationship in this industry tends to be quite volatile
(which isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing), it often makes sense for companies to look for a near-immediate payoff
when&nbsp;hiring.</p>
<p>We owe it to the prevalent open source technologies that this isn&#8217;t entirely unreasonable. If your software stack
is composed entirely of components that are available in the open, you can probably find engineers who are familiar
with most of them. They can be productive members of your team almost literally from day&nbsp;one!</p>
<h4>Right tool for the&nbsp;job</h4>
<p>The most important observation is that every company is <em>different</em>, and following the One True Best Practice™ will likely
prevent you from utilizing the best qualities of your work place. Smaller shops, for example, could take a more personalized
approach to hiring: let candidates actually sit with engineers, solve real-life problems, and have deep technical&nbsp;conversations.</p>
<p>Of course, you may still find whiteboard coding valuable in its own right. Indeed, a simple test for at least
the basic programming skill appears to be a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">necessary sanity check</a>.</p>
<p>But a full suite of difficult technical interviews with tough algorithmic problems that last a better part of the day?
Most likely&nbsp;not.</p>
