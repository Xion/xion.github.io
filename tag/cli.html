  </header>
  <div>
      <p>In this post, I want to discuss some of the experiences I had with a project
that I recently finished, <a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht"><em>gisht</em></a>.
By &#8220;finished&#8221; I mean that I don&#8217;t anticipate developing any new major features for it,
though smaller things, bug fixes, or non-code stuff, is of course still very&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking this is as much &#8220;done&#8221; as most software projects can ever hope to be.
Thus, it is probably the best time for a recap / summary / postmortem / etc. &#8212;
something to recount the lessons learned, and assess the choices&nbsp;made.</p>
<h4>Some&nbsp;context</h4>
<p>The original purpose of <em>gisht</em> was to facilitate download <span class="amp">&amp;</span> execution of GitHub gists
straight from the command&nbsp;line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>gisht Xion/git-outgoing  <span class="c"># run the https://gist.github.com/Xion/git-outgoing gist</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I initially wrote <a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht.py">its first version in Python</a>
because I&#8217;ve accumulated a sizable number of small <span class="amp">&amp;</span> useful scripts
(for Git, Unix, Python, etc.) which were all posted as gists.
Sure, I could download them manually to <code>~/bin</code> every time I used a new machine
but that&#8217;s rather cumbersome, and I&#8217;m quite&nbsp;lazy.</p>
<p>Well, lazy <em>and</em> impatient :)
I noticed pretty fast that the speed tax of Python
is basically unacceptable for a program like <em>gisht</em>.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m referring to here is not the speed of code execution, however,
but only the <em>startup time</em> of Python interpreter.
Irrespective of the machine, operating system, or language version,
it doesn&#8217;t seem to go lower than about one hundred milliseconds;
empirically, it&#8217;s often 2 or 3 times higher than that.
For the common case of finding a cached gist (no downloads)
and doing a simple <code>fork</code>+<code>exec</code>,
this startup time was very noticeable and extremely jarring.
It also precluded some more sophisticated uses for <em>gisht</em>,
like putting its invocation into the shell&#8217;s <code>$PROMPT</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Speed:&nbsp;delivered</h4>
<p>And so the obvious solution emerged:
let&#8217;s <a href="https://transitiontech.ca/random/RIIR">rewrite it in Rust</a>!&#8230;</p>
<p>Because if I&#8217;m executing code straight from the internet,
I should at least do it in a <em>safe</em>&nbsp;language.</p>
<p>But jokes aside, it is obvious that a language compiling to native code
is likely a good pick if you want to optimize for startup speed.
So while the choice of Rust was in large part educational
(<em>gisht</em> was one of my first projects to be written in it),
it definitely hasn&#8217;t disappointed&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Even without any intentional optimization efforts,
the app still runs <em>instantaneously</em>.
I tried to take some measurements using the <code>time</code> command,
but it never ticked into more than 0.001s.
Perceptively, it is at least on par with <code>git</code>,
so that&#8217;s acceptable for me&nbsp;:)</p>
<h4>Can&#8217;t segfault if your code doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;build</h4>
<p>Achieving the performance objective wouldn&#8217;t do us much good, however,
if the road to get there involved excessive penalties on productivity.
Such negative impact could manifest in many ways,
including troublesome debugging due to a tricky runtime<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>,
or difficulty in getting the code to compile in the first&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>If you had even a passing contact with Rust,
you&#8217;d expect the latter to be much more likely than the&nbsp;former.</p>
<p>Indeed, Rust&#8217;s very design eschews runtime flexibility to a ridiculous degree
(in its &#8220;safe&#8221; mode, at least),
while also forcing you to absorb subtle <span class="amp">&amp;</span> complex ideas
to even get your code past the compiler.
The reward is increased likelihood your program will behave as intended &#8212;
although it&#8217;s definitely not on the level of &#8220;if it compiles, it works&#8221;
that can be offered by Haskell or&nbsp;Idris.</p>
<p>But since <em>gisht</em> is hardly mission critical,
I didn&#8217;t actually care too much about this increased reliability.
I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s likely that Rust would buy me much over something like modern C++.
And if I were to <em>really</em> do some kind of cost-benefit analysis of several languages
&#8212; rather than going with Rust simply to learn it better &#8212;
then it would be hard to justify it over something like&nbsp;Go.</p>
<h4>It&nbsp;scales</h4>
<p>So the real question is: has Rust <em>not hampered</em> my productivity too much?
Having the benefit of hindsight,
I&#8217;m happy to say that the trade-off was definitely acceptable&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>One thing I was particularly satisfied with was the language&#8217;s <em>scalability</em>.
What I mean here is the ability to adapt as the project grows,
but also to start quickly and remain nimble
while the codebase is still pretty&nbsp;small.</p>
<p>Many languages (most, perhaps) are naturally tailored towards the large end,
doing their best to make it more bearable to work with big codebases.
In turn, they often forget about helping projects take off in the first place.
Between complicated build systems and dependency managers (Java),
or a virtual lack of either (C++),
it can be really hard to get going in a &#8220;serious&#8221; language like&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, languages like Python make it very easy to start up
and achieve relatively impressive results.
Some people, however, report having encountered problems
once the code evolves past certain size.
While I&#8217;m actually
<a href="http://xion.io/post/programming/long-live-dynamic-languages.html">very unsympathetic</a> to those claims,
I realize perception plays a significant role here,
making those anecdotal experiences into a sort of self-fulfilling&nbsp;prophecy.</p>
<p>This perception problem should almost certainly spare Rust,
as it&#8217;s a natively compiled and statically typed language,
with a respectable type system to boot.
There is also <a href="https://servo.org/">some evidence</a>
that the language works well in large projects already.
So the only question that we might want to ask is:
how easy it is to actually <em>start</em> a project in Rust,
and carry it towards some kind of <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product"><span class="caps">MVP</span></abbr>?</p>
<p>Based on my experiences with <em>gisht</em>,
I can say that it is, in fact, quite easy.
Thanks mostly to the impressive Swiss army knife of <code>cargo</code>
&#8212; acting as both package manager and a rudimentary build system &#8212;
it was almost Python-trivial to cook a &#8220;Hello World&#8221; program
that does something tangible, like
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/de1be876784d671dd84618c3a15d0836f9fd5697/src/main.rs">talk to a <span class="caps">JSON</span> <span class="caps">API</span></a>.
From there, it only took a few coding sessions to grow it
into a <a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/tree/5c156cb">functioning prototype</a>.</p>
<h4>Abstractions&nbsp;galore</h4>
<p>As part of rewriting <em>gisht</em> from Python to Rust,
I also wanted to fix some longstanding issues that limited its&nbsp;capabilities.</p>
<p>The most important one was the hopeless coupling to GitHub
and their particular flavor of gists.
Sure, this is where the project even got its name from,
but people use a dozen of different services to share code snippets
and it should very possible to support them&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it became necessary to utilize
the abstraction capabilities that Rust has to offer.
It was somewhat obvious to
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/3fc443dc9986612fd46b4311ca2ecbc613a15cf9/src/gist.rs#L16">define a <code>Host</code> trait</a>
but of course its exact form had to be
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/commit/26746dfc2eac68b67753f71148eb9897a861914e#diff-9d0a9c0911fa012f0fcf8ca56b43f8c5">shaped</a>
over <a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/commit/1e54ad05480b42089977171f10d4727beca5f835#diff-9d0a9c0911fa012f0fcf8ca56b43f8c5">numerous iterations</a>.
Along the way, it even turned out that <code>Result&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>Option&lt;Result&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>
are sometimes <a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/d9c30e69d58b2a4e5608e6c8a1aa6392133b490f/src/hosts/mod.rs#L44">both necessary</a>
as return types&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Besides cleaner architecture,
another neat thing about an explicit abstraction is
the ability to slice a concept into smaller pieces &#8212;
and then put <em>some of them</em> back together.
While the <code>Host</code> trait could support a very diverse set of gist services and <em>pastebins</em>,
many of them turned out to be just a slight variation of one central theme.
Because of this similarity, it was possible to introduce
a single <a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/d2e78b1f5ee4616b1d5eb7067c3c5dd0ce9e2fe4/src/hosts/simple.rs#L26"><code>Basic</code> implementation</a>
which handles multiple services through varying sets of <span class="caps">URL</span>&nbsp;patterns.</p>
<p>Devices like these aren&#8217;t of course specific to Rust:
interfaces (traits) and classes are a staple of <span class="caps">OO</span> languages in general.
But some other techniques were more idiomatic;
the concept of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html">iterators</a>, for example,
is flexible enough to accommodate
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/4fa347c6197190b0f6c68dd548efc28287a5859f/src/hosts/github.rs#L354">looping over GitHub user&#8217;s gists</a>,
even as they read directly from <span class="caps">HTTP</span>&nbsp;responses.</p>
<h4>Hacking&nbsp;time</h4>
<p>Not everything was sunshine and rainbows,&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>Take <em>clap</em>, for example.
It&#8217;s mostly a very good crate for parsing command line arguments,
but it couldn&#8217;t <em>quite</em> cope with the unusual requirements that <em>gisht</em> had.
To make <code>gisht Foo/bar</code> work alongside <code>gisht run Foo/bar</code>,
it was necessary to
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/commit/0eff00e31f94f3856558ebb1f6655a9e6fc50ca6#diff-7397f82f682a49eb62e2b056118124d0">analyze <code>argv</code></a>
before even handing it over to <code>clap</code>.
This turned out to be
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/commit/e7ab06a01d4675947965ec82fc6f3ec5a2517c89#diff-7397f82f682a49eb62e2b056118124d0">surprisingly tricky</a>
to get right.
Like,
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/commit/69e8aad4a1743beb57184dc38150ef02b306a0a1#diff-7397f82f682a49eb62e2b056118124d0">really</a>
tricky, with
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/commit/acadcfa0a97fe52584fbf8198541baa8733cb0a5#diff-7397f82f682a49eb62e2b056118124d0R58">edges cases</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/commit/a9eb599168f5b6821aefa46dde0b0a89a41cd4e6#diff-7397f82f682a49eb62e2b056118124d0R562">stuff</a>.
But as it is often the case in software,
the answer turned out to be yet another layer of indirection plus
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/src/args.rs#L457-L578">a copious amount of tests</a>.</p>
<p>In another instance, however, a direct library support was&nbsp;crucial.</p>
<p>It so happened that <em>hyper</em>, the crate I&#8217;ve been using for <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests,
didn&#8217;t handle the <code>Link:</code> response header out of the box<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.
This was a stumbling block that prevented the gist iterator (mentioned earlier)
from correctly handling pagination in the responses from GitHub <span class="caps">API</span>.
Thankfully, having <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.11.7/hyper/header/trait.Header.html">the <code>Header</code> abstraction</a> in <em>hyper</em>
meant it was possible to add the missing support in
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/src/ext/hyper.rs">a relatively straighforward manner</a>.
Yes, it&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/src/ext/hyper.rs#L23">not a universal implementation</a>
that&#8217;d be suitable for <em>every</em> <span class="caps">HTTP</span> client,
but it does the job for <em>gisht</em> just&nbsp;fine.</p>
<h4>Test-Reluctant&nbsp;Development</h4>
<p>And so the program kept growing steadily over the months,
most notably through
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/src/hosts/mod.rs#L101">more and more gist hosts</a>
it could now&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>Eventually, some of them would fall into a sort of twilight zone.
They weren&#8217;t as complicated as GitHub to warrant writing a completely new <code>Host</code> instance,
but they also couldn&#8217;t be handled via
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/src/hosts/common/basic.rs#L28">the <code>Basic</code> structure</a> alone.
A good example would be <a href="http://sprunge.us/">sprunge.us</a>:
mostly an ordinary pastebin,
except for its optional syntax highlighting
which may add some &#8220;junk&#8221; to the otherwise regular&nbsp;URLs.</p>
<p>In order to handle those odd cases,
I went for a classic wrapper/decorator pattern which, in its essence,
boils down to something like&nbsp;this:</p>

<p>Despite the noticeable boilerplate of a few pass-through methods,
I was pretty happy with this solution, at least initially.
After a few more unusual hosts, however,
it became cumbersome to fix all the edge cases
by looking only at the final output of the inner <code>Basic</code> implementation.
The code was evidently asking for some <em>tests</em>,
if only to check how the inner structure is being&nbsp;called.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard, right?&#8230; Yeah, that&#8217;s what I thought,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>The reality, unfortunately, fell very short of those expectations.
Stubs, mocks, fakes &#8212;
<a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2013/07/testing-on-toilet-know-your-test-doubles.html"><em>test doubles</em></a>
in general &#8212;
are a dark and forgotten corner of Rust
that almost no one seems to pay any attention to.
Absent a proper library support &#8212; much less a language one &#8212;
the only way forward was to roll up my sleeves
and implement
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/src/testing/inmemory_host.rs">a fake <code>Host</code></a>
from&nbsp;scratch.</p>
<p>But that was just the beginning.
How do you seamlessly inject this fake implementation into the wrapper
so that it replaces the <code>Basic</code> struct for testing?
If you are not careful and go for the &#8220;obvious&#8221; solution &#8212; a trait&nbsp;object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Sprunge</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">inner</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Host</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>you&#8217;ll soon realize that you need not just a <code>Box</code>, but at least an <code>Rc</code> (or maybe even <code>Arc</code>).
Without this kind of shared ownership,
you&#8217;ll lose your chance to interrogate the test double once you hand it over to the wrapper.
This, in turn, will heavily limit your ability to write effective&nbsp;tests.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the non-obvious approach, then?
The full rationale would probably warrant a separate post,
but the working recipe looks more or less like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, <em>parametrize</em> the wrapper with its inner type:
  <code>pub struct Sprunge&lt;T: Host&gt; { inner: T }</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put that in an internal module with the correct visibility&nbsp;setup:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">mod</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">internal</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Sprunge</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Host</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">super</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">inner</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Make the regular (&#8220;production&#8221;) version of the wrapper into an <em>alias</em>,
  giving it the type parameter that you&#8217;ve been using directly<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Sprunge</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">internal</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Sprunge</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Basic</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Change the <code>new</code> constructor to instantiate the <code>internal</code> type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In tests, create the wrapper with a fake <code>inner</code> object&nbsp;inside.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see in
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/src/hosts/sprunge.rs">the real example</a>,
this convoluted technique removes the need for any pointer indirection.
It also permits you to
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/src/hosts/sprunge.rs#L152">access the out-of-band interface</a>
that a fake object would normally&nbsp;expose.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame, though, that so much work is required for something
that should be very simple.
As it appears, testing is still a neglected topic in&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<h4>Packing&nbsp;up</h4>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just Rust that played a notable role in the development of <em>gisht</em>.</p>
<p>Pretty soon after getting the app to a presentable state,
it became clear that a mere <code>cargo build</code> won&#8217;t do everything
that&#8217;s necessary to carry out a complete build.
It <em>could</em> do more, admittedly,
if I had the foresight to explore <a href="http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html">Cargo build scripts</a>
a little more thoroughly.
But overall, I don&#8217;t regret dropping back to my trusty ol&#8217; pick:&nbsp;Python.</p>
<p>Like in a few previous projects, I used the <a href="http://pyinvoke.org">Invoke task runner</a>
for both the crucial and the auxiliary automation tasks.
It is a relatively powerful tool
&#8212; and probably the best in its class in Python that I know of &#8212;
though it can be a bit capricious if you want to
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/tasks/release/__init__.py#L69">really fine-tune it</a>.
But it does make it much easier to organize your automation code,
to reuse it between tasks, and to (ahem) <em>invoke</em> those tasks in a convenient&nbsp;manner.</p>
<p>In any case, it certainly beats a collection of disconnected Bash scripts&nbsp;;)</p>
<p>What have I automated in this way, you may ask?
Well, a couple of small things; those&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>embedding of the current Git commit hash into the binary,
to help identify the exact revision in the logs of any potential bug reports<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after a successful build,
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/tasks/build.py#L40">replacing</a>
the <em>Usage</em> section in <em><span class="caps">README</span></em> with the program&#8217;s <code>--help</code> output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>generating <a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/tasks/build.py#L96">completion scripts</a>
for popular shells by invoking the binary with a magic hidden flag (courtesy of <em>clap</em>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Undoubtedly the biggest task that I relegated to Python/Invoke,
was the preparation of
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/tasks/release/__init__.py"><em>release packages</em></a>.
When it comes to the various Linuxes (currently Debian and Red Hat flavors),
this wasn&#8217;t particularly complicated.
Major thanks are due to the amazing <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm"><em>fpm</em> tool</a> here,
which I recommend to anyone who needs to package their software in a distro-compatible&nbsp;manner.</p>
<p>Homebrew, however &#8212; or more precisely, <span class="caps">OS</span> X itself &#8212; was quite a different story.
Many, <a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/commits/a5423a63d10221c50faa1cb30a999a85286853a1">many</a>
failed attempts were needed to even get it to build on <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis</a>,
and the additional dependency on Python was
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/ci/travis/before_install-osx.sh#L15">partially to blame</a>.
To be fair, however, most of the pain was exclusively due to OpenSSL;
getting that thing to build is always <a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/issues/255">loads of &#8220;fun&#8221;</a>,
especially in such an opaque and poorly debuggable environment as&nbsp;Travis.</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;wrap</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s probably a lot of minor things and tidbits I could&#8217;ve mentioned along the way,
but the story so far has most likely covered all the important topics.
Let&#8217;s wrap it up then, and highlight some interesting points in the classic <em>Yay/Meh/Nay</em>&nbsp;manner.</p>
<h5>Yay</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was definitely a good choice to rewrite <em>gisht</em> specifically in Rust.
Besides all the advantages I&#8217;ve mentioned already,
it is also worth noting that the language went through about 10 minor version bumps
while I was working on this project.
Of all those new releases,
I don&#8217;t recall a single one that would introduce a breaking&nbsp;change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the Rust ecosystem (third-party libraries) was a joy to use,
and very easy to get started with.
Honorable mention goes to <em>serde_json</em> and how easy it was to
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/commit/a0655a6a5b86c05df5665e3bc7f1512f2476c9e4">transition the code</a>
from <em>rustc_serialize</em> that I had used at&nbsp;first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a possible exception of sucking in node.js as a huge dependency of your project
and using Grunt, there is probably no better way of writing automation <span class="amp">&amp;</span> support code than Python.
There may eventually be some Rust-based task runners that could try to compete,
but I&#8217;m not very convinced about using a compiled language for this purpose
(and especially one that takes so long to&nbsp;build).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Meh</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While <a href="https://docs.rs/clap">the <em>clap</em> crate</a> is quite configurable and pretty straightforward to use,
it does lack at least <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/issues/568">one feature</a>
that&#8217;d be very nice for <em>gisht</em>.
Additionally, working with raw <em>clap</em> is often a little tedious,
as it doesn&#8217;t assist you in translating parsed flags into your own configuration types,
and thus requires
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/30df960052f2a03270bbb5ca1f7be0920978007d/src/args.rs#L138-L182">shuffling those bits</a>
manually<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being a <em>defacto</em> standard for continuous integration in open-source projects,
<a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis <span class="caps">CI</span></a> could be a <em>little</em> less finicky.
In almost every project I decide to use it for,
I end up with about half a dozen commits
that frantically try to fix silly configuration issues,
all before even a simple <em>.travis.yml</em> works as intended.
Providing a way to test <span class="caps">CI</span> builds locally would be an obvious way to avoid this&nbsp;churn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Nay</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Testing in Rust is such a weird animal.
On one hand, there is a first-class, out-of-the-box support for unit tests
(and even integration tests) right in the toolchain.
On the other hand, the relevant parts of the ecosystem are immature or lacking,
as evidenced by the dreary story of mocking and stubbing.
It&#8217;s no surprise that there is a long way to catch up to languages with the strongest testing culture
(Java and C#/.<span class="caps">NET</span><sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>), but it&#8217;s disappointing to see Rust outclassed
<a href="https://github.com/google/googletest">even by C++</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting anything to build reliably on <span class="caps">OSX</span> in a <span class="caps">CI</span> environment is already a tall order.
But if it involves things as OpenSSL, then it quickly goes from bad to terrible.
I&#8217;m really not amused anymore how this &#8220;Just Works&#8221; system often turns out to hardly work at&nbsp;all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t want to end on such a negative note,
I feel compelled to state the obvious fact: every technology choice is a trade-off.
In case of this project, however, the drawbacks were <em>heavily</em> outweighed by the&nbsp;benefits.</p>
<p>For this reason, I can definitely recommend the software stack I&#8217;ve just described
to anyone developing non-trivial, cross-platform command line&nbsp;tools.</p>

      <p><em>&#8230;not for standalone programs&nbsp;anyway.</em></p>
<p>Chances are, you have written some command line programs in Python. This is quite probable even if you normally code
in some other language. And if you have, it is not unlikely that you needed to parse the <code>argv</code> of your program at one
point or&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>There are plenty of options here, both in the standard library as well as among third party packages. One does stand out,
however, and it&#8217;s mostly for how it is often overused. I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://click.pocoo.org/">Click</a>&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use it in your next Python program, I hereby urge you to&nbsp;reconsider.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s the&nbsp;fuss?</h4>
<p><img style="float:right; margin-left: 8px; margin: bottom: 7px" src="http://xion.io/images/click-logo.png" alt="click_">
The somewhat bizarrely named Click library is described as a &#8220;package for creating beautiful
command line interfaces&#8221;. Its main trick is the ability to create subcommands by adorning Python functions with the
<code>@click.command()</code> decorator<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It then makes them coalesce into an argument parser, equipped with the necessary
dispatching&nbsp;logic.</p>
<p>This idea isn&#8217;t new, of course. Prior art goes back at least seven years to the now-abandoned
<a href="https://opster.readthedocs.io">opster</a> package. Click, however, was the first one of its kind to garner noticeable
popularity, which is easily attributed to <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/">whom it&#8217;s been authored by</a>.</p>
<p>So while my arguments against using this kind of <span class="caps">CLI</span> framework would apply to any package implementing the paradigm,
it just happens that Click is currently its most prominent example. Purely for the sake of convenience, I will therefore
refer to it as if it was interchangeable with the whole concept. Because why not? Whatever you may say about
the library&#8217;s name, it&#8217;s hard to imagine a more concise moniker than a simple <em>Click</em>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong, then, with the way Click handles command line&nbsp;interfaces?</p>
<h4><span class="caps">CLI</span>: Little&nbsp;Interfaces</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s how it encourages to treat them as an <em>accidental afterthought</em> rather than a deliberate design&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>For applications invoked repeatedly from a terminal, their command line arguments and flags are the primary means of
user interaction<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It is how users communicate their intent to perform an action; provide the neccessary input data
to carry it throgh; decide how they want to receive the output; and control many other aspects of the programs execution.
Absent graphical components and widgets, the command line is virtually the only way to interact with a terminal&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>In other words, it is <strong>the <span class="caps">UI</span></strong>.</p>
<p>And how important the <span class="caps">UI</span> is for <em>any</em> application? It seems to be important enough that entire fields of study are devoted
to reducing friction of human-computer interaction. In many projects, the emphasis on user interface design is on par
with that of actual software engineering.<br>
Like everything, of course, it is susceptible to trends and fads (such as the recent &#8220;mobile/responsive everything!&#8221;
craze). But its significance remains undiminished. Quite the opposite: in the age of ubiquitous computing,
user interfaces are probably more important than&nbsp;ever.</p>
<p>Yes, this includes <span class="caps">CLI</span>. One of the main reasons we turn to the command line are <em>speed</em> and <em>efficacy</em>. Common tasks must
utilize short and convenient syntax that is quick to integrate into user&#8217;s muscle memory. Others should not only be
possible, but <em>discoverable</em> and <em>accessible</em> without going through reams of <code>man</code> pages.</p>
<p>Any terminal program intended for frequent use by humans should therefore strive to excel in those two qualities.
But except for <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/echo">the simplest of cases</a>, it won&#8217;t happen by itself.
Designing an efficient <span class="caps">CLI</span> for any non-trivial application is a challenging and demanding&nbsp;task.</p>
<h4>It doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;click</h4>
<p>With Click, however, we&#8217;re encouraged to just wing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Click tells us to slap some decorators on our top-level functions and call it a day. Sure, you can dig deep enough
and uncover the underlying layers of abstraction that may eventually allow you do things for which <code>argparse</code> has
a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#mutual-exclusion">first-class support</a>.</p>
<p>By default, however, Click shoehorns your programs into
<a href="http://click.pocoo.org/5/quickstart/#basic-concepts">predefined patterns</a> that, incidentally, mirror those of some
<a href="http://click.pocoo.org/5/complex/#building-a-git-clone">least intuitive</a> command-line tools in&nbsp;existence.</p>
<p>Indeed, the whole idea of subdiving your program into several distinct is already suspect, for it appears at odds
with the fundamental Unix philosophy of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well">doing one thing well</a>. While it is
occasionally justified, it shouldn&#8217;t be the first thing that comes to your mind. But that&#8217;s completely at odds with the
Click&#8217;s approach, where <em>not</em> ending up with multiple distinct commands is something you have to consciously&nbsp;avoid.</p>
<h4>&#8230;though it sometimes&nbsp;might</h4>
<p>So, what <em>am</em> I suggesting you use instead libraries such as Click?&#8230; Nothing outrageous,&nbsp;really.</p>
<p>If you care about your command line interface, consider just using
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">the <code>argparse</code> module</a>. Yes, it will force you to create parser objects,
add arguments <span class="amp">&amp;</span> flags to it, and in general pay some attention to the whole business. When it comes to <span class="caps">UI</span>, it&#8217;s always
good to make it an explicit concern, maybe even sufficient to warrant
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/gisht/blob/e86af37388573f00a4d6f282feca76ead88725d8/gisht/args/parser.py">its own module</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <a href="https://github.com/docopt/docopt"><code>docopt</code> library</a> provides another take on the <span class="caps">UI</span>-first approach
to <span class="caps">CLI</span>, though it is more limited in its capabilities<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;m not advocating to ditch Click in <em>all</em> scenarios. There&#8217;s plenty of situations when we&#8217;re interested in
getting <em>any</em> <span class="caps">CLI</span> up and running, and not so much in making the most efficient and intuitive interface possible. The prime
example is any kind of automation scripts that are ancillary to some bigger project, like <em>manage.py</em> is in Django<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
The Python ecosystem doesn&#8217;t really have dedicated task runners that are as featureful as <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a>
or <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>, and that makes Click a viable and compelling option<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But for standalone programs whose <span class="caps">CLI</span> is the main interface? Yeah, not&nbsp;really.</p>
