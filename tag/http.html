      <p><em>&#8230;or: Is Rust&nbsp;webscale?</em></p>
<p>In this day and age, no language can really make an impact anymore
unless it enables its programmers to harness the power of the Internet.
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> is no different here.
Despite posing as a true systems language
(as opposed to those <a href="http://golang.org/">only marketed as such</a>),
it includes <a href="https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/roadmap-2017/text/0000-roadmap-2017.md#rust-should-be-well-equipped-for-writing-robust-high-scale-servers">highly scalable servers</a>
as a prominent objective in its 2017&nbsp;agenda.</p>
<p>Presumably to satisfy this very objective,
the Rust ecosystem has recently seen some major developments
in the space of <em>asynchronous I/O</em>.
Given the pace of those improvements,
it may seem that production quality async services are quite possible&nbsp;already.</p>
<p>But is that so?
How exactly do you write async Rust servers in the early to mid&nbsp;2017?</p>
<p>To find out, I set to code up a toy application.
Said program was a small intermediary/<span class="caps">API</span> server (a &#8220;microservice&#8221;, if you will)
that tries to hit many of the typical requirements that arise in such projects.
The main objective was to test the limits of asynchronous Rust,
and see how easily (or difficult) they can be&nbsp;pushed.</p>
<p>This post is a summary of all the lessons I&#8217;ve learned from&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>It is necessarily quite long,
so if you look for some <span class="caps">TL</span>;<span class="caps">DR</span>, scroll down straight to <em>Conclusions</em>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://xion.io/images/jump-to-conclusions-mat.jpeg"></p>

<h4>Asynchro-what?</h4>
<p>Before we dive in, I have to clarify what &#8220;asynchronous&#8221; means in this context.
Those familiar with async concepts can freely skip this&nbsp;section.</p>
<h5>Pulling some&nbsp;threads</h5>
<p>Asynchronous processing (or <em>async</em> for short) is brought up most often
in the context of I/O operations: disk reads, network calls, database queries,
and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, all those tasks tend to be <em>slow</em>:
they take orders of magnitude longer than just executing code or even accessing <span class="caps">RAM</span>.
The &#8220;traditional&#8221; (synchronous) approach to dealing with them
is to relegate those tasks to separate <em>threads</em>.</p>
<p>When one thread has to wait for a lengthy I/O operation to complete,
the operating system (its <em>scheduler</em>, to be precise) can suspend that thread.
This lets others execute their code in the mean time and not waste <span class="caps">CPU</span>&nbsp;cycles.</p>
<p>This is the essence of <em>concurrency</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h5>Schedule&nbsp;yourself</h5>
<p>But threads are not the only option when dealing with many things (i.e. requests) at&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>The alternative approach is one where no threads are automatically suspended or resumed
by the <span class="caps">OS</span>. Instead, a special version of I/O subroutines
allows the program to continue execution immediately after issuing an I/O call.
While the operation happens in the background<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>,
the code is given an opaque handle &#8212; usually called a promise, a <em>future</em>,
or an async result &#8212; that will eventually resolve to the actual return&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>The program can wait for the handle synchronously,
but it would typically hand it over to an <em>event loop</em>,
an abstraction provided by a dedicated async framework.
Such a framework (among which node.js is probably the best known example)
maintains a list of all I/O &#8220;descriptors&#8221; (fds in Unix)
that are associated with pending I/O&nbsp;operations.</p>
<p>Then, in the loop, it simply waits on <em>all</em> of them,
usually via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll"><code>epoll</code> system call</a>.
Whenever an I/O task completes, the loop would execute a <em>callback</em> associated
with its result (or promise, or future).
Through this callback, the application is able to process&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>In a sense, we can treat the event loop as a dedicated scheduler for its&nbsp;program.</p>
<h5>But&nbsp;why?</h5>
<p>So, what exactly the benefit of asynchronous I/O?
If anything, it definitely sounds more complicated for the programmer. (Spoiler alert: it&nbsp;is).</p>
<p>The impetus for the development of async techniques most likely came from
the <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html"><span class="caps">C10K</span> problem</a>.
The short version of it is that computers are nowadays very fast
and should therefore be able to serve thousands of requests simultaneously.
(especially when those requests are mostly I/O, which translate to waiting time for the <span class="caps">CPU</span>).</p>
<p>And if &#8220;serving&#8221; queries is indeed almost all waiting,
then handling thousands of clients should be very&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>In some cases, however, it was found that when the <span class="caps">OS</span> is scheduling the threads,
it introduces too much overhead on the frequent pause/resume state changes (<em>context switching</em>).
Like I mentioned above, the asynchronous alternative does away with all that,
and indeed lets the <span class="caps">CPU</span> just wait (on <code>epoll</code>) until something interesting happens.
Once it does, the application can deal with it quickly,
issue another I/O call, and let the server go back to&nbsp;waiting.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s processing power we can theoretically handle
<em>a lot</em> of concurrent clients this way: up to hundreds of thousands or even&nbsp;millions.</p>
<h5>Reality&nbsp;check</h5>
<p>Well, ain&#8217;t that grand? No wonder everyone is writing everything in node.js&nbsp;now!</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the <em>actual</em> benefits of asynchronous I/O
(especially when weighed against its inconvenience for developers)
are a bit harder to quantify.
For one, they rely heavily on the assumption of fast code <span class="amp">&amp;</span> slow I/O being valid in all&nbsp;situations.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t really self-evident, and becomes increasingly dubious as time goes on
and code complexity grows.
It should be obvious, for example, that a Python web frontend
talking mostly to in-memory caches in the same datacenter will have radically different
performance characteristics than a C++ proxy server calling <span class="caps">HTTP</span> APIs over public Internet.
Those nuances are often lost in translation between simplistic benchmarks
and exaggerated blog posts<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Upon a closer look, however, these details point quite clearly in favor of asynchronous Rust.
Being a language that compiles to native code, it should usually run faster
than interpreted (Python, Ruby) or even JITed (<span class="caps">JVM</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> .<span class="caps">NET</span>) languages,
very close to what is typically referred to as &#8220;bare metal&#8221; speed.
For async I/O, it means the event loop won&#8217;t be disturbed for a (relatively) long time
to do some trivial processing, leading to higher potential throughput of&nbsp;requests.</p>
<p>All in all, it would seem that Rust is one of the few languages
where async actually <em>makes sense</em>.</p>
<h4>Rust: the story so&nbsp;far</h4>
<p>Obviously, this means it&#8217;s been built into the language right from the start&#8230;&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Well, not really.
It was always possible to use native <code>epoll</code> through <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ffi.html"><span class="caps">FFI</span></a>,
of course, but that&#8217;s not exactly the level of abstraction we&#8217;d like to work with.
Still, the upper layers of the async I/O stack have been steadily growing at least since Rust&nbsp;1.0.</p>
<p>The major milestones here include <a href="https://docs.rs/mio"><em>mio</em></a>,
a comparatively basic building block that provides an asynchronous version of <span class="caps">TCP</span>/<span class="caps">IP</span>.
It also offers idiomatic wrappers over <code>epoll</code>, allowing us to write our own event&nbsp;loop.</p>
<p>On the application side, <a href="https://docs.rs/futures">the <em>futures</em> crate</a> abstracts the notion
of a potentially incomplete operation into, well, a <em>future</em>.
Manipulating those futures is how one can now write asynchronous code in&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="http://tokio.rs">Tokio</a> has been emerging as
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/04/10/mozilla-awards-365000-to-open-source-projects-as-part-of-moss/"><em>defacto</em> framework</a>
for async I/O in Rust. It essentially combines the two previously mentioned crates,
and provides additional abstractions specifically for network clients and&nbsp;servers.</p>
<p>And finally, the popular <span class="caps">HTTP</span> framework <a href="http://hyper.rs">Hyper</a> is now also supporting
asynchronous request handling via Tokio.
What this means is that bread-and-butter of the Internet&#8217;s application layer &#8212;
<span class="caps">API</span> servers talking <span class="caps">JSON</span> over <span class="caps">HTTP</span> &#8212; should now be fully supported by the ecosystem
of asynchronous&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take it for a spin then, shall&nbsp;we?</p>
<h4>The Grand&nbsp;Project</h4>
<p>Earlier on, we have established that the main use case for asynchronous I/O
is intermediate microservices.
They often sit somewhere between a standard web frontend and a storage server or a database.
Because of their typical role within a bigger system,
these kinds of projects don&#8217;t tend to be particularly exciting on their&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>But perhaps we can liven them up a&nbsp;little.</p>
<p>In the end, it is all about the Internet that we&#8217;re talking here,
and everything on the Internet can usually be improved by one simple&nbsp;addition.</p>
<p align="center">

            Image source
        </a>
    </small>
</p>

<p>&#8230;Okay, <em>two</em> possible additions &#8212; the other one&nbsp;being:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://xion.io/images/oprah-memes.png" alt="Memes!"></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re really pedantic, you may call them <em>image macros</em>.
But regardless of the name, the important part is putting text on pictures,
preferably in a funny&nbsp;way.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld">The microservice I wrote</a> is doing just that.
Thought it won&#8217;t ensure your memes are sufficiently hilarious,
it will try to deliver them exactly to
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/blob/e25e9d01bdd7e85452e6a5922770dae941d5b61c/src/caption/mod.rs#L32">your specifications</a>.
You may thus think of it as possible backend for
<a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/caption">an image site like this one</a>.</p>
<h5>Flimsy excuses <span class="amp">&amp;</span> post-hoc&nbsp;justifications</h5>
<p>It is, of course, a <em>complete</em> coincidence,
lacking <em>any</em> premeditation on my part,
that when it comes to evaluating an async platform,
a service like this fits the bill <em>very well</em>.</p>
<p>And especially when said platform is async <em>Rust</em>.</p>
<p>Why, though, is it such a happy, er,&nbsp;accident?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a simple, well-defined application</strong>.
  There is basically a <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/blob/e25e9d01bdd7e85452e6a5922770dae941d5b61c/src/service.rs#L33">single endpoint</a>,
  accepting simple input (<span class="caps">JSON</span> or query string) and producing a straightforward result (an image).
  No need to persist any state made creating
  <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/blob/8026eab34ea54c4ba1b814c1114b3f5d87020233/src/main.rs">an <span class="caps">MVP</span></a>
  significantly&nbsp;easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching can be used for meme templates and fonts.</strong>
  Besides being an inherent part of most network services,
  a cache also represents a point of contention for Rust programs.
  The language is widely known for its alergy to global mutable state,
  which is exactly what programmatic caches boil down&nbsp;to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Image captioning is a <span class="caps">CPU</span>-intensive operation.</strong>
  While the &#8220;async&#8221; part of async I/O may sometimes go all the way down,
  many practical services either evolve some important <span class="caps">CPU</span>-bound code,
  or require it right from the start.
  For this reason, I wanted to check if <span class="amp">&amp;</span> how async Rust can mix
  with threaded&nbsp;concurrency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration knobs can be added.</strong>
  Unlike trivial experiments in the vein of an echo or &#8220;Hello world&#8221; server,
  this kind of service warrants some flags that the user could tweak,
  like the number of image captioning threads, or the size of the template cache.
  We can see how easy (or how hard) it is to make them applicable across
  all future-based&nbsp;requests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, and despite its frivolous subject matter,
a meme server is actually hitting quite a few notable spots in the microservice&nbsp;domain.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/meme-shocked.png" alt="">
</p>

<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>As you may glean from its <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld">GitHub repo</a>,
it would seem that the experiment was successful.
Sure, you could implement some features in the captioning department
(supporting animated GIFs comes to mind),
but none of these are pertinent to the async mechanics of the&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>And since it&#8217;s the async (I/O) in Rust that we&#8217;re interested in,
let me now present you with an assorted collection of practical experiences with&nbsp;it.</p>
<h5>&gt;0-cost&nbsp;futures</h5>
<p>If you read the docs&#8217; preamble to <a href="https://docs.rs/futures">the <code>futures</code> crate</a>,
you will see it mentioning the &#8220;zero-cost&#8221; aspect of the library.
Consistent with the philosophy behind Rust,
it proclaims to deliver its abstractions without any&nbsp;overhead.</p>
<p>Thing is, I&#8217;m not sure how this promise can be delivered on in&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p>Flip through <a href="https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/simple-server/">the introductory tutorial to Tokio</a>,
for example, and you will already find plenty of compromises.
Without the crucial (but nightly-only)
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1522-conservative-impl-trait.md"><code>impl Trait</code> feature</a>,
you are basically required to put all your futures in a <code>Box</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
They even encourage it themselves, offering a convenient
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.13/futures/future/trait.Future.html#method.boxed"><code>Future::boxed</code> method</a>
exactly for this purpose, as well the matching
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.13/futures/future/type.BoxFuture.html"><code>BoxFuture</code> typedef</a>
right in the&nbsp;crate.</p>
<p>But hey, you can always just use nightly Rust, right?
<code>impl Trait</code> will stabilize eventually, so your code should be, ahem, <em>future-proof</em> either&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this assumes all the futures that you&#8217;re building your request handlers from
shall never cross any thread boundaries.
(<code>BoxFuture</code>, for example, automatically constrains them to be <code>Send</code>).
As you&#8217;ve likely guessed, this doesn&#8217;t jive very well with computationally intensive tasks
which are best relegated to a separate&nbsp;thread.</p>
<p>To deal with them properly, you&#8217;re going to need a thread pool-based executor,
which is currently implemented in the <a href="https://docs.rs/futures-cpupool"><code>futures_cpupool</code> crate</a>.
Using it requires a lot of care, though,
and a deep understanding of <em>both</em> types of concurrency&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p>Evidently, this was something that I lacked at the time,
which is why I encountered problems ensuring that my futures are properly <code>Send</code>.
In the end, I settled on <em>making</em> them <code>Send</code> in the most straightforward
(and completely <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/commit/19d37cef4bb2e917e54c862ef138c7da4378d03e">unnecessary</a>) manner:
by <a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/blob/7e7d3b160594689d2e4c80b7328f90f34546b955/src/ext.rs#L39">wrapping them in <code>Arc</code>/<code>Mutex</code></a>.
That in itself wasn&#8217;t
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/rofld/commit/15bcd60f76a97badb9b90721179daa0845b139dd#diff-126a37e2b594610dd09c3f228d9d1717L52">without its perils</a>,
but at least allowed me to move&nbsp;forward.</p>
<p>Ironically, this also shows an important, pragmatic property of the futures&#8217; system:
sub-par hacks around it <em>are</em> possible &#8212;
a fact you&#8217;ll be glad to know about on the proverbial day before a&nbsp;deadline.</p>
<h5>Templates-worthy error&nbsp;messages</h5>
<p>Other significant properties of the futures&#8217; abstraction shall include
telling the programmer what&#8217;s wrong with his code in the simplest,
most straightforward, and concise manner&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>Here, let me show you an&nbsp;example:</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/rust-futures-error.png"><br>
    <small>
        &#8230;which you can also behold in its
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/df1fb7fffa1afb4bfbf2838b9c3fc4c1">
            gist form
        </a>.
    </small>
</p>

<p>The reason you will encounter such incomprehensible messages
stems from the very building blocks of async&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Right now, each chained operation on a future &#8212; <code>map</code>, <code>and_then</code>, <code>or_else</code>, and so on &#8212;
produces a <em>nested type</em>.
Every subsequent application of those methods
&#8220;contains&#8221; (in terms of the type system) <em>all the previous ones</em>.
Keep going, and it will eventually balloon into one big onion of <code>Chain&lt;Map&lt;OrElse&lt;Chain&lt;Map&lt;...etc...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/meme-yo-dawg.jpeg"><br>
    <small>Futures are like ogres.</small>
</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t personally hit any compiler limits in this regard,
but I&#8217;m sure it is plausible for a complicated, real-world&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>It also gets <em>worse</em> if you use nightly Rust with <code>impl Trait</code>.
In this case, function boundaries no longer &#8220;break&#8221; type stacking
via <code>Box</code>ing the results into trait objects.
Indeed, you can very well end up with some truly gigantic constructs
as the compiler tries represent the return types of your most complex&nbsp;handlers.</p>
<p>But even if rustc is up to snuff and can deal with those fractals just fine,
it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the <em>programmer</em> can.
Looking at those error messages,
I had vivid flashbacks from hacking on C++ templates with ancient compilers like <span class="caps">VS2005</span>.
The difference is, of course, that we&#8217;re not trying any arcane metaprogramming here;
we just want to do some relatively mundane&nbsp;I/O.</p>
<p>I have no doubt the messaging will eventually improve,
and the mile-long types will at least get pretty-printed.
At the moment, however, prepare for some serious squinting and&nbsp;bracket-counting.</p>
<h5>Where is my (language)&nbsp;support?</h5>
<p>Sadly, those long, cryptic error messages are not the only way
in which the Rust compiler disappoints&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>I keep mentioning <code>impl Trait</code> as a generally desirable language feature
for writers of asynchronous code.
This improvement is still a relatively long way from getting precisely
<a href="https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/expand-impl-trait/text/0000-expand-impl-trait.md"><em>defined</em></a>,
much less stabilized.
And it is only a somewhat minor improvement in the async&nbsp;ergonomics.</p>
<p>The wishlist is vastly longer and even more&nbsp;inchoate.</p>
<p>Saying it bluntly, right now Rust doesn&#8217;t really support the async style <em>at all</em>.
All the combined <span class="caps">API</span> surface of futures/Tokio/Hyper/etc. is a clever,
but ultimately contrived design,
and it has no intentional backing in the Rust language&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>This is a stark contrast with numerous other languages.
They often support asynchronous I/O as something of a first class feature.
The list includes at least
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt674882.aspx">C#</a>,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">Python 3.5+</a>,
<a href="https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/async/awaitables">Hack/<span class="caps">PHP</span></a>,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"><span class="caps">ES8</span> / JavaScript</a>,
and basically all the functional languages.
They all have dedicated <code>async</code>, <code>await</code>, or equivalent constructs
that make the callback-based nature of asynchronous code essentially&nbsp;transparent.</p>
<p>The absence of similar support puts Rust in the same bucket as frontend JavaScript circa 2010,
where <code>.then</code>-chaining of promises reigned supreme.
This is of course better than the callback hell of early Node,
but I wouldn&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a particularly high bar.
In this regard, Rust leaves plenty to be&nbsp;desired.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/vadimcn/rfcs/blob/coroutines2/text/0000-coroutines.md">proposals</a>,
obviously, to bring async coroutines into Rust.
There is an even broader wish to make the language cross the <span class="caps">OOP</span>/<span class="caps">FP</span> fence already
and commit to the functional way; this would mean adding an equivalent of Haskell&#8217;s <code>do</code> notation.</p>
<p>Either development could be sufficient.
Both, however, require significant amount of design and implementation work.
If solved now, this would easily be the most significant addition to the language
since its 1.0 release &#8212; but the solution is currently in the <span class="caps">RFC</span> stages <em>at best</em>.</p>
<h5>Future&lt;Ecosystem&gt;</h5>
<p>While the core language support is lacking,
the great as usual Rust community has been picking up some of the slack
by establishing and cultivating a steadily growing&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<p>The constellation of async-related crates clusters mostly around the two core libraries:
<code>futures</code> crate itself and Tokio.
Any functionality you may need while writing asynchronous should likely be found
quite easily by searching for one of those two keywords (plus Rust, of course).
Another way of finding what you need is to look at
<a href="https://tokio.rs/docs/going-deeper-tokio/third-party/">the list of Tokio-related crates</a>&nbsp;directly.</p>
<p>To be fair, I can&#8217;t really say much about the completeness of this ecosystem.
The project didn&#8217;t really require too many external dependencies &#8212;
the only relevant ones&nbsp;were:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>futures_cpupool</code> mentioned&nbsp;before</li>
<li><code>tokio-timer</code> for imposing a timeout on caption&nbsp;requests</li>
<li><code>tokio-signal</code> which handles <span class="caps">SIGINT</span>/Ctrl+C  and allows for a graceful&nbsp;shutdown</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, you&#8217;d also want to research the async database drivers
for your storage system of choice.
I would not expect anything resembling the <a href="http://diesel.rs">Diesel</a> <span class="caps">ORM</span> crate, though,
nor a web framework comparable to <a href="http://ironframework.io/">Iron</a>,
<a href="https://fengsp.github.io/pencil/pencil/">Pencil</a>,
or <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>Alright, so what can we get from this overall&nbsp;analysis?</p>
<p>Given the rapid development of async Rust ecosystem so far,
it is clear the technology is very promising.
If the community maintains its usual enthusiasm and keeps funneling it into Tokio et al.,
it won&#8217;t be long before it matures into something&nbsp;remarkable.</p>
<p>Right now, however, it exposes way too many rough edges to fully bet on it.
Still, there may be some applications
where you could get away with an async Rust backend even in production.
But personally, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it outside of non-essential services,
or tools internal to your&nbsp;organization.</p>
<p>If you do use async Rust for microservices,
I&#8217;d also advise to take steps to ensure they remain &#8220;micro&#8221;.
Like I&#8217;ve elaborated in the earlier sections,
there are several issues that make future-based Rust code scale poorly
with respect to maintainability.
Keeping it simple is therefore&nbsp;essential.</p>
<p>To sum up, async Rust is currently an option only for the adventurous and/or small.
Others should stick to a tried <span class="amp">&amp;</span> tested solution:
something like Java (with <a href="http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/">Quasar</a>),
.<span class="caps">NET</span>, Go, or perhaps node.js at the very&nbsp;least.</p>
<div class="footnote">

and then implement the necessary trait for it.<br>
For iterators, this works reasonably well,
and you don&#8217;t need custom ones that often anyway.

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p><a href="http://python-requests.org">Requests</a> is a widely used Python library that provides a nicer <span class="caps">API</span> for writing <span class="caps">HTTP</span> clients
than the standard <code>urllib2</code> module does. It deals with authentication in an especially concise way: through
a simple <code>auth=</code> argument, rather than a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/kennethreitz/973705">separate password manager <span class="amp">&amp;</span> authentication handler</a> or other such&nbsp;nonsense.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/authentication/">several possible ways</a>
to authenticate an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> call with Requests, and it&#8217;s pretty easy to
<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/authentication/#new-forms-of-authentication">implement our own approach</a>
if the server requires it. All the built-in ways, however, as well as
<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#custom-authentication">the examples of custom implementations</a>,
are heavily biased towards using <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers to transmit the necessary credentials (such as username/password
or some kind of opaque&nbsp;token).</p>
<h4>Non-standard&nbsp;auth</h4>
<p>This is actually quite reasonable: the most popular authentication methods, including OAuth 1.0 <span class="amp">&amp;</span> 2.0, use <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers
either primarily or&nbsp;exclusively.</p>
<p>Not every <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> follows this convention, though. Sometimes, credentials are put in other parts of the request,
commonly the <span class="caps">URL</span> itself. It may seem like a bad idea at first but it can also be perfectly acceptable:
credentials don&#8217;t have to expose secrets of any particular <em>user</em> of the remote&nbsp;system.</p>
<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/dev">Steam <span class="caps">API</span></a> is a good example here. Calling any of
<a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#Interfaces_and_method">its endpoints</a> requires providing
an <span class="caps">API</span> key but it grants no special rights to access data of any particular Steam user. All the information
it returns is already visible on their public profile<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For those special authentication schemes, Requests necessitate rolling out our own implementation.
Thankfully, doing so is mostly pretty&nbsp;straightforward.</p>
<h4>Simple&nbsp;example</h4>
<p>All Requests&#8217; authenticators are callable objects inheriting from <code>requests.auth.AuthBase</code> class.
Writing your own is hence a matter of defining a subclass of <code>AuthBase</code> with at least a <code>__call__</code> method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">SillyAuth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">AuthBase</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__call__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">headers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;X-ID&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;im valid so auth is yes&#39;</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">request</span>

<span class="c"># usage</span>
<span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;http://example.com&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">auth</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">SillyAuth</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The job of an authenticator is to modify the <code>request</code> so that it includes appropriate credentials in whatever form
necessary to have them accepted by the remote server. Like I&#8217;ve mentioned before, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers are the most common option,
but the request can be modified in other ways as&nbsp;well.</p>
<h4>Query string&nbsp;parameters</h4>
<p>One problem with modifying a query string, though, is that it&#8217;s a part of request <span class="caps">URL</span>. By the time it reaches
authenticators, the Requests library has already merged any additional query params into it<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Including more params
will thus require modifying the <span class="caps">URL</span>.</p>
<p>Though it may sound like a risky endeavour involving string manipulations that are fraught with security issues,
it&#8217;s not really <em>that</em> bad at all. In fact, the Requests library provides an <span class="caps">API</span> to do exactly&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">QueryStringAuth</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">AuthBase</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Authenticator that attaches a set of query string parameters</span>
<span class="sd">    (e.g. an API key) to the request.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">params</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">params</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__call__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prepare_url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">request</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Albeit <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#requests.PreparedRequest.prepare_url">scantly documented</a>,
the <code>prepare_url</code> method will take an existing <span class="caps">URL</span> and a dictionary of query string params, and outfit the request
with a brand new <span class="caps">URL</span> that contains those params neatly&nbsp;encoded.</p>
<p>Full implementation of <code>QueryStringAuth</code> is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/Xion/9c1bbbc287d4443dbaf5">little more involved</a>
than the snippet above, because we should like to replicate all the idiosyncracies of how
<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#passing-parameters-in-urls">regular Requests <span class="caps">API</span></a>
handles query string params. Some of them &#8212; like allowing both strings and lists as param values &#8212; are taken care of
by <code>prepare_url</code> itself, but the rest should be dealt with on our&nbsp;own.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>To finish up, let&#8217;s use this authenticator to call Steam <span class="caps">API</span> and return a
<a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetOwnedGames_.28v0001.29">list of games</a>

<p>We could&#8217;ve put <code>STEAM_API_KEY</code> directly in <code>params</code>, of course. Singling it out explicitly as an authentication
detail, however, makes the code clearer and plays nicely with more advanced features of Requests,
such as <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects">sessions</a>.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>It can be said that only in this case we&#8217;re dealing with exclusively <em>authentication</em>, whereas the others
also perform <em>authorization</em>. I wouldn&#8217;t quibble too much about those details. The fact that both terms are often
shortened to &#8220;auth&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exactly help with distinguishing them anyway.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>In fact, what <code>AuthBase.__call__</code> receives is a special
<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#prepared-requests"><code>PreparedRequest</code> object</a> which contains
the exact bytes that&#8217;ll be sent to the server. Most of the higher level abstractions offered by the Requests library
(like form data or <span class="caps">JSON</span> request body) has been compiled to raw octets at this point. This is done to allow
some authenticators (like OAuth) to analyze the full request payload and sign it cryptographically
as a part of their flow.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  </header>
  <div>
      <p>In <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>, a popular web framework for Python, it&#8217;s pretty easy to implement custom handlers
for specific <span class="caps">HTTP</span> errors. All you have to do is to write a function and annotate it with the <code>@errorhandler</code> decorator:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@app.errorhandler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">404</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">not_found</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">error</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">render_template</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;errors/404.html&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Albeit simple, the above example is actually very realistic. There&#8217;s rarely anything else to do in response to serious
request error than to send back some <span class="caps">HTML</span> with an appropriate message. If you have more handlers like that, though,
you&#8217;ll notice they get pretty repetitive: for each erroneous <span class="caps">HTTP</span> status code (404, 403, 400, etc.),
pick a corresponding template and simply render&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Which is, of course, why we&#8217;d want to deal with all in a little smarter way and with less&nbsp;boilerplate.</p>
<h4>Just add a&nbsp;template</h4>
<p>Ideally, we would like to avoid writing any Python code at all for each individual error handler. Since all we&#8217;re doing
revolves around predefined templates, let&#8217;s just define the handlers automatically based on the <span class="caps">HTML</span> files&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>Assuming we store them in the same template directory &#8212; say, <code>errors/</code> &#8212; and name their files after
numeric status codes (e.g. <em>404.html</em>), getting all those codes is quite simple<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Once we have them, we can try wiring up the handlers programmatically and making them do the right&nbsp;thing.</p>
<h4>One function to handle them&nbsp;all</h4>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve used a plural here, in reality we only need a single handler, as it&#8217;ll be perfectly capable of
dealing with any <span class="caps">HTTP</span> error we bind it to. To help distinguishing between the different status codes,
Flask by default invokes our error handlers with an
<a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/exceptions/#werkzeug.exceptions.HTTPException"><code>HTTPException</code></a> argument
that has the <code>code</code> as an&nbsp;attribute:</p>

<p>Catching <code>TemplateNotFound</code> exception is admittedly a little paranoid here, as it can occur pretty much exclusively
due to a programming error elsewhere. Feel free to treat it as a failed assertion about application&#8217;s internal state
and e.g. convert to <code>AssertionError</code> if&nbsp;desirable.</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;setup</h4>
<p>The final step is to actually set up the&nbsp;handler(s):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">get_supported_error_codes</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">errorhandler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="n">error_handler</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It may look a bit wonky, but it&#8217;s just a simple desugaring of the standard Python decorator syntax from the first example.
There exists a more direct approach of putting the handler inside <code>app.error_handler_spec</code> dictionary,
but it is <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.Flask.errorhandler">discouraged by Flask documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Where to put the above code, though? I posit it&#8217;s perfectly fine to place in the module&#8217;s global scope,
because the error handlers (and other request handlers) are traditionally defined at import time&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>Also notice that the default error handling we&#8217;ve defined here doesn&#8217;t preclude more specialized variants
for select <span class="caps">HTTP</span> codes. All you have to do is ensure that your custom <code>@app.errorhandler</code> definition occurs
<em>after</em> the above&nbsp;loop.</p>
