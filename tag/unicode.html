      <p>I&#8217;ll blurt it straight up: I&#8217;m not a big fan of Python&nbsp;3.</p>
<p>For a long time, I resisted the appeal of various incremental improvements
that early 3.x releases offered.
And the world agreed with me:
a mere two years ago, Python 3 wasn&#8217;t even <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2014/jan/03/pypi-download-statistics/">a blip on the PyPI radar</a>.</p>
<p>Lately, however, things seem to be picking up some&nbsp;steam.</p>
<p>As if to compensate for years of &#8220;good enough&#8221;,
Python 3 development team has given in to a steadily accelerating feature creep.
Sure, some of it results in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/">bad ideas</a>
(or even <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0628/">ideas you&#8217;d hope are jokes</a>),
but it nevertheless causes an increasingly wide functional gap
between the 2.x and 3.x&nbsp;series.</p>
<p>Starting from around Python 3.5, this gap becomes really noticeable,
even when partially bridged with many excellent backports.
The ecosystem support is also mostly there,
at least insofar as &#8220;not breaking horribly when a package is used in Python&nbsp;3&#8221;.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there is <a href="https://hg.python.org/peps/rev/76d43e52d978">the 2.7 EoL date</a> looming ever&nbsp;closer.</p>
<p>Given all those portents,
even old curmudg&#8230; ahem&#8230; <em>seasoned developers</em> cannot really ignore Python 3 anymore.
For better or for worse, 3.x is how Python will look like in the coming years and decades.
Might as well prepare for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>In this post, I will discuss some important issues
one should be aware of before trying to switch from Python 2 to 3.
I won&#8217;t be talking about all the minute changes and additions,
but cover the more significant, broader concepts
that mark the divide between the 2.x and 3.x&nbsp;generations.</p>
<p>The two concepts I&#8217;ll be mentioning here are
<em>Unicode</em> (obviously) and <em>lazy vs. eager computation</em>.</p>
<h4>Unicode&nbsp;handling</h4>
<p>You have probably heard it before.
Python 3 was going to solve your Unicode problems once and for all.
You haven&#8217;t believed it, of course,
like you wouldn&#8217;t believe in any other silver&nbsp;bullet.</p>
<p>Still, it may be rather surprising to learn
that in Python 3, you&#8217;ll actually see much <em>more</em> Unicode-related&nbsp;errors.</p>
<p>And strange as it may sound, it is  a <em>good</em>&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>In any case, either version of Python gets the most important thing about Unicode right.
They both distinguish, at the type level,
between <em>strings</em> (of Unicode codepoints) and their <em>encodings</em> (sequences of bytes).
The type that holds the latter is called <code>bytes</code> in both versions,
while strings are stored within the <code>str</code> type in Python 3 and <code>unicode</code> in Python&nbsp;2.</p>
<p>It is from this crucial distinction &#8212; or rather, failing to account for it &#8212;
where all the dreaded Unicode errors ultimately&nbsp;stem.</p>
<p>But where Python 2 does poorly is in the choice of defaults.
You probably know all too well that <code>bytes</code> there is just an alias for <code>str</code>.
That <code>str</code> is a fully functional string type,
even though it can only contain <span class="caps">ASCII</span> characters.
Moreover, it is also the <em>default</em>:
quoted string literals, for example, will be of this type unless specially&nbsp;marked.</p>
<p>This poor choice of defaults is the primary source of latent Unicode bugs in Python 2&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>What Python 3 does here is to help <em>expose those bugs</em> sooner.
If you already deal with Unicode correctly in your programs
&#8212; maybe because you watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHbC6udIqc">this excellent talk by Ned Batchelder</a> &#8212;
your main benefit will be not having to write that <code>u""</code> quotes anymore.
Otherwise, it&#8217;ll force you to consider the issue from the very beginning,
rather than letting you write &#8220;working&#8221; programs
that crash the moment they have to process some non-<span class="caps">ASCII</span>&nbsp;input.</p>
<h4>Laziness by&nbsp;default</h4>
<p>The second major change that Python 3 brings is of similar nature.
It is also a change of <em>defaults</em>, but the impetus for it is much less&nbsp;evident.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s different in Python 3 is that many built-in functions and methods which used to return <code>list</code>s
are now giving out bespoke objects that only <em>mostly</em> behave like <code>list</code>s.
Included in these are functions like <code>map</code> or <code>filter</code>,
as well as common <code>dict</code>ionary methods such as <code>keys</code> or <code>values</code>.</p>
<p>This change is usually presented as removal of unnecessary&nbsp;cruft:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itertools.ifilter</code> is now just <code>filter</code></li>
<li><code>xrange</code> is now just <code>range</code></li>
<li><code>dict.iteritems</code> is now just <code>dict.items</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>In some cases, this is exactly what happens.
For example, there is virtually no downside to the new implementation of <code>range</code>,
especially considering the way it is used most&nbsp;often.</p>
<p>But not every built-in managed to preserve all the functionality of <code>list</code>s.
Indeed, many have <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=iterator#map">downgraded</a>
their <span class="caps">API</span> guaratees to those of mere <em>generators</em>,
i.e. the most simplistic and limited flavor of Python iterables.
Working with them is trickier and more error-prone than with lists,
which is due to <a href="http://xion.org.pl/2012/02/08/generator-pitfalls/">various pitfalls</a>
that generators expose us&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>Navigating around those gotchas used to be something that Python code had to opt-in to,
by explicitly importing <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/itertools.html">the <code>itertools</code> module</a>
and using its functions in place of the built-ins.
What you could gain in return was increased performance, and a lesser memory footprint.
All those benefits came from making the computations <em>lazy</em>
and refraining from storage of the intermediate&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>In Python 3, however, laziness is <em>preordained</em>.
Even if we don&#8217;t need or care about the aforementioned perks,
we have to devise some way of dealing with the pervasive&nbsp;generators.</p>
<p>One option is to embrace lazy evaluation fully,
and adapt to handling unspecified iterables throughout our code bases.<br>
The risk is an increased frequency of bugs stemming from generator misuse &#8212;
including a common mistake of trying to iterate over lazy <code>foos</code> the second time,
deeper down a long function, after it&#8217;s been already&nbsp;exhausted.</p>
<p>The alternative is to engage in a lot of &#8220;defensive <code>list</code>ing&#8221;:
wrapping of unknown (or known-but-lazy) iterables in <code>list()</code> calls
in order to &#8220;sanitize&#8221; them for later (re)use.<br>
Examples include immediate <code>list</code>ification of a generator&nbsp;object:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">primes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">is_prime</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>or preemptive conversion of an incoming iterable&nbsp;argument:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foos</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">foos</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foos</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c"># ...the rest of a long function...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Even if you choose the first path, and somehow use lazy generators everywhere,
conversions are still required at the serialization&nbsp;boundaries:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&#39;foo&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">json</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dumps</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s">&#39;keys&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">d</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">keys</span><span class="p">()})</span>  <span class="c"># TypeError: dict_keys([&#39;foo&#39;]) is not JSON serializable</span>
<span class="n">json</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dumps</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s">&#39;keys&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">keys</span><span class="p">())})</span>  <span class="c"># works</span>
</pre></div>


<p>At least in this case, the lazy iterable will vocally fail with an exception,
rather than silently doing nothing (in case of repeated iteration)
or always posing as truthy even when it&#8217;s empty (in <code>if iterable:</code> checks).</p>
<h4>from __future__ import&nbsp;doubts</h4>
<p>So, here they are: the highlights of Python 3.
If you are disappointed they all turned out to be mixed blessings,
don&#8217;t worry: you are
<a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/12/7/thoughts-on-python3/">in</a>
<a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/1/5/unicode-in-2-and-3/">a</a>
<a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/5/12/everything-about-unicode/">good</a>
<a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/8/16/the-python-i-would-like-to-see/">company</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is that Python 3 is more finnicky, less forgiving,
and much less beginner-friendly than its predecessor.
Its various <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0237/">superficial simplifications</a> are almost squarely balanced
by many new concerns that are thrust upon an unsuspecting programmer from the very&nbsp;beginning.</p>
<p>In one possible view, this is simply a sign that the language has <em>matured</em>.
Perhaps it&#8217;s not a coincidence
that almost exactly <a href="http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/01/brief-timeline-of-python.html">18 years</a>
has passed between the first public version of Python (0.9)
and the release of Python 3.0.
By no conceivable means it is a toy language anymore,
and it&#8217;s adequately equipped to tackle challenges presented by the computing world of&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it&#8217;s clear something is being gradually lost in the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s becoming harder to claim the language favors simplicity
over <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/">complexity</a>.<br>
It is no longer so easy to pick <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/">which way</a>
is the <em>obvious</em> way to do it.<br>
It is increasingly often that <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3113/">ugly replaces beautiful</a>
and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3108/">nested replaces flat</a>.</p>
<p>Little by little, Python itself is becoming less and less <em>pythonic</em>.
The pace isn&#8217;t breakneck, but it&#8217;s definitely noticeable.
But who knows? Maybe after two decades,
a wholesale redefinition of the language&#8217;s core principles really <em>is</em> in&nbsp;order.</p>
<p>&#8230;Well, certainly that&#8217;s necessary if some of the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/">latest ideas</a>
are about to get&nbsp;in!</p>
