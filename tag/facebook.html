  <div>
      <p>Approximately a year ago,
I had the opportunity to work on <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/745068642270222/fighting-spam-with-haskell/">Sigma</a>
&#8212; a large, distributed system that protects Facebook users from spam and other kinds of&nbsp;abuse.</p>
<p>One reason it was a pretty unique experience is that Sigma is almost entirely a <em>Haskell</em> codebase.
It was the first time I got to work with the language in a professional setting,
so I was eager to see how it performs in a real-world, production-grade&nbsp;application.</p>
<p>In this (rather long) post, I&#8217;ll draw on this experience
and highlight Haskell&#8217;s notable features from a practical, engineering standpoint.
In other words, I&#8217;ll be interested in how much does it help with solving actual problems
that arise in the field of software development <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;maintenance.</p>
<h4>Haskell&nbsp;Who?</h4>
<p>Before we start, however,
it seems necessary to clarify what &#8220;Haskell&#8221; are we actually talking&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Granted, this may be a little surprising.
From a far-away vantage point,
Haskell is typically discussed as a rather uniform language,
and it is often treated as synonymous with <em>functional programming</em> in&nbsp;general.</p>
<p>But if you look closer, that turns out to be a bit of a misrepresentation.
In reality, Haskell is a complex manifold of different components,
some of which can be thought as their own sublanguages.
Roughly speaking, Haskell
&#8212; as it&#8217;s used in the industry and in the <span class="caps">OSS</span> world today &#8212;
should be thought of as a cake with at least the following&nbsp;layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The base Haskell language, as defined by the Haskell &#8216;98 and 2010 reports.
At least in theory, this is the <em>portable</em> version of the language
that any conforming compiler is supposed to accept.
In practice, given <a href="http://taylor.fausak.me/2017/11/15/2017-state-of-haskell-survey-results/#question-14">the absolute monopoly of <span class="caps">GHC</span></a>,
it is merely a theoretical base that needs to be significantly augmented
in order to reach some level of practical&nbsp;usability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bunch of <span class="caps">GHC</span> extensions that are
<a href="http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#the-benign">widely considered</a>
mandatory for any real-world project.
Some, like <code>TupleSections</code> or <code>MultiParamTypeClasses</code>,
are mostly there to fix some surprising feature gaps
that would be more confusing if you had worked around them instead.
Others, like <code>GADTs</code> or <code>DataKinds</code>,
open up completely new avenues for type-level&nbsp;abstractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A repertoire of common third-party libraries with unique DSLs,
like <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit"><em>conduit</em></a>,
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes"><em>pipes</em></a>,
or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-tutorial-1.0.3/docs/Control-Lens-Tutorial.html"><em>lens</em></a>.
Unlike many &#8220;regular&#8221; packages that merely bring in some domain-specific <span class="caps">API</span>,
these fundamental libraries shape both the deeper architecture
and the surface-level look <span class="amp">&amp;</span> feel of any Haskell codebase that uses&nbsp;them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A selection of <a href="https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2014-12-01-24-days-of-ghc-extensions.html">less common extensions</a>
which are nevertheless encountered in Haskell code with some&nbsp;regularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Template_Haskell">Template Haskell</a>,
the language for compile-time metaprogramming whose main application is probably <em>generics</em>.<br>
To be clear, neither &#8220;template&#8221; nor &#8220;generics&#8221; have anything to do with the usual meanings
of those terms in C++ and Java/C#/Go<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
Rather, it refers to a kind of <span class="caps">AST</span>-based &#8220;preprocessing&#8221;
that allows Haskell code to operate on the generic <em>structure</em> of user-defined types:
their constructors, parameters, and record fields<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.<br>
Direct use of <span class="caps">TH</span> in application code is extremely rare,
but many projects rely on libraries which utilize it behind the scenes.
A great example would be <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent-2.7.1/docs/Database-Persist.html">Persistent</a>,
a database interface library where the <span class="caps">ORM</span>
uses Template Haskell to construct record types from a <span class="caps">DB</span> schema at compile&nbsp;time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>There is a language in my type&nbsp;system</h4>
<p>What&#8217;s striking about this ensemble of features and ideas
is that most of them don&#8217;t seem to follow from the ostensible premise of the language:
that it is functional, pure / referentially transparent, and non-strict / lazily evaluated.
Instead, they are mostly a collection of progressively more sophisticated refinements
and applications of Haskell&#8217;s <em>type system</em>.</p>
<p>This singular focus on type theory &#8212; especially in the recent years<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> &#8212;
is probably why many people in the wider programming world think
it is necessary to grok advanced type system concepts
if you even want to dabble in functional&nbsp;programming</p>
<p>That is, of course, patently untrue<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
<em>Some</em> features of a strong static type system are definitely useful to have in a functional language.
You can look at <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>
to see <a href="http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Result#map3">how awkward</a>
things become when you deprive an <span class="caps">FP</span> language of its typeclasses
and <a href="http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Result#andThen">composition sugar</a>.</p>
<p>But when the focus on type systems becomes too heavy,
the concepts <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_system">keep piling up</a>
and the language becomes increasingly impenetrable.
Eventually, you may end up with an ecosystem where the recommended way to implement an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">API</span>
is to call upon
<a href="http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/Server.html#a-first-example">half a dozen compiler extensions</a>
in order to specify it as
<a href="http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/Server.html#from-combinators-to-handler-arguments">one humongous type</a>.</p>
<p>But hey, isn&#8217;t it desirable to have this kind of increased type&nbsp;safety?</p>
<p>In principle, the answer would of course be yes.
However, the price we pay here is in the precious currency of <em>complexity</em>,
and it often turns out to be way too high.
When libraries, frameworks, and languages get complicated and abstract,
it&#8217;s not just safety and/or productivity that can (hopefully) increase &#8212;
it is also the burden on developers&#8217; thought processes.
While the exact threshold of diminishing or even negative returns is hard to pinpoint,
it can definitely be reached even by the smartest and most talented teams.
Add in the usual obstacles of software engineering &#8212; shifting requirements,
deadlines, turnover &#8212; and you may encounter it much sooner than you&nbsp;think.</p>
<p>For some, this is a sufficient justification to basically
<a href="https://golang.org/">give up on type systems</a> altogether.
And while I&#8217;d say such a knee-jerk reaction is rather excessive and unwarranted,
it is at least equally harmful to letting your typing regime grow in boundless complexity.
Both approaches are just too extreme to stand the test of&nbsp;practicality.</p>
<h4>The legacy of bleeding&nbsp;edge</h4>
<p>In other words, Haskell <em>is</em> hard and this <em>does</em> count as one of its serious problems.
This conclusion isn&#8217;t exactly novel or surprising,
even if some people would <a href="http://dave.fayr.am/posts/2011-08-19-lets-go-shopping.html">still argue with it</a>.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, that we have somehow caused this issue to disappear completely.
Let&#8217;s say that through some kind of divine intervention,
it was made so that the learning curve of Haskell
is no longer a problem for the majority of programmers.
Maybe we found a magic lamp and &#8212; for the lack of better ideas &#8212;
we wished that everyone be as proficient
in applicative parsers as they are in inheritance&nbsp;hierarchies.</p>
<p>Even in this hypothetical scenario, I posit that
the value proposition of Haskell would <em>still</em> be a tough&nbsp;sell.</p>
<p>There is this old quote from Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of C++)
where he says that programming languages divide into those everyone complains about,
and those that no one uses.<br>
The first group consists of old, established technologies
that managed to accrue significant complexity debt through years and decades of evolution.
All the while, they&#8217;ve been adapting to the constantly shifting perspectives
on what are the best industry practices.
Traces of those adaptations can still be found today,
sticking out like a leftover appendix or residual tail bone &#8212;
or like the built-in support for <span class="caps">XML</span> in&nbsp;Java.</p>
<p>Languages that &#8220;no one uses&#8221;, on the other hand,
haven&#8217;t yet passed the industry threshold of sufficient maturity and stability.
Their ecosystems are still cutting edge, and their future is uncertain,
but they sometimes champion some really compelling paradigm shifts.
As long as you can bear with things that are rough around the edges,
you can take advantage of their novel&nbsp;ideas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Haskell,
it manages to combine the <em>worst parts</em> of both of these&nbsp;worlds.</p>
<p>On one hand, it is a surprisingly old language,
clocking more than two decades of fruitful research around many innovative concepts.
Yet on the other hand, it bears the signs of a fresh new technology,
with relatively few production-grade libraries,
scarce coverage of some domains (e.g. <span class="caps">GUI</span> programming),
and not too many stories of commercial&nbsp;successes.</p>
<h4>There are many ways to do&nbsp;it</h4>
<p>Nothing shows better the problems of Haskell&#8217;s evolution over the years
than the various approaches to handling <em>strings</em> and <em>errors</em> that it now has.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<h5>String&nbsp;theory</h5>
<p>Historically, <code>String</code> has been defined as a list of <code>Char</code>acters,
which is normally denoted as the <code>[Char]</code> type.
The good thing about this representation is that many string-based algorithms
can simply be written using just the list&nbsp;functions.</p>
<p>The bad thing is that Haskell lists are the so-called <em>cons lists</em>.
They consist of the single element (called <code>head</code>),
followed by another list of the remaining elements (called <code>tail</code>).
This makes them roughly equivalent to what the data structures theory
calls a <em>singly-linked list</em>
&#8212; a rarely used construct that has a number of undesirable&nbsp;characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>linear time (<code>O(n)</code>) for finding a specific element in the&nbsp;list</li>
<li>linear time for finding an element with a specific <em>index</em> in the&nbsp;list</li>
<li>linear time for insertion in the middle of the&nbsp;list</li>
<li>poor cache coherency due to scattered allocations of list nodes<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, keeping only a single character inside each node
results in a significant waste of&nbsp;memory.</p>
<p>Given those downsides,
it isn&#8217;t very surprising that virtually no serious Haskell program
uses <code>String</code>s for any meaningful text processing.
The community-accepted replacement is <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text">the <em>text</em> package</a>,
whose implementation stores strings inside packed arrays, i.e. just as you would expect.
As a result, Haskell has at least two main types of &#8220;strings&#8221; &#8212; or even <em>three</em>,
since <code>Text</code> has both lazy and strict&nbsp;variants.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all, however:
there is also <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring">the <em>bytestring</em> package</a>.
Although technically it implements generic byte buffers,
its <span class="caps">API</span> has been <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-0.10.8.2/docs/Data-ByteString.html#g:11">pretty rich and enticing</a>.
As a result, many other packages would rather use <code>ByteString</code>s directly in their interfaces
than to incur the conversions to and from <code>Text</code>.<br>
And just like in case of <code>Text</code>,
separate lazy and strict variants of <code>ByteString</code> are also available.
But unlike <code>Text</code>, byte strings also have <code>Word8</code> and <code>Char8</code> versions,
where the latter is designed to handle legacy cases of <span class="caps">ASCII</span>-exclusive text&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you kept count of all these types!
I also hope you can memorize the correct way of converting between them,
because it&#8217;s commonplace to see them used simultaneously.
This may sometimes happen even within the same library,
but it definitely occurs in application code
that utilizes many different dependencies.
What it usually results in are numerous occurrences of something like <code>Text.pack . foo . Text.unpack</code>,
with conversion functions copiously sprinkled in
to help win in the <a href="http://javran.github.io/posts/2014-02-28-type-tetris-and-typeclassopedia.html">Type Tetris</a>.</p>
<h5>Errors and how to handle&nbsp;them</h5>
<p>A somewhat similar issue applies to error handling.
Over the years, Haskell has tried many approaches to this problem,
often mixing techniques that are very rarely found in a single language,
like exceptions combined with result&nbsp;types.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there is some consensus about those
<a href="https://prime.haskell.org/wiki/Libraries/Proposals/MonadFail">mistakes of the past</a>,
but the best we got is their deprecation:
the current version of <span class="caps">GHC</span> still supports them&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>What are all those techniques? Here&#8217;s an abridged&nbsp;list:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>error</code> function, terminating the program with a message
  (which is obviously&nbsp;discouraged)</li>
<li>the <code>fail</code> method of the <code>Monad</code> typeclass
  (which is now deprecated and moved to <code>MonadFail</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.1/docs/Control-Monad-Error.html#t:MonadError">the <code>MonadError</code> class</a>
  with the associated <code>ErrorT</code> transformer, now deprecated in favor&nbsp;of&#8230;</li>
<li>a <em>different</em> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.1/docs/Control-Monad-Except.html#t:MonadError"><code>MonadError</code> class</a>,
  with <code>ExceptT</code> as the new&nbsp;transformer</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.0.0/docs/Control-Exception.html">exceptions in the <code>IO</code> monad</a>,
  normally raised by the standard I/O calls to signal abnormal conditions and error;
  however, libraries and application code are free to <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.0.0/docs/Control-Exception.html#g:2">also throw them</a>
  and use for their own error&nbsp;handling</li>
<li>the <code>Either</code> sum type / monad, which is essentially a type-safe version of the venerable return&nbsp;codes</li>
</ul>
<p>If you really stretched the definition of error handling,
I could also imagine counting <code>Maybe</code>/<code>MaybeT</code> as yet another method.
But even without it, that&#8217;s half a dozen distinct approaches
which you are likely to encounter in the wild in one form or&nbsp;another.</p>
<h4>Implicit is better than&nbsp;explicit</h4>
<p>The other kind of troublesome legacy of Haskell
relates to the various design choices in the language itself.
They reflect ideas straight from the time they were conceived in,
which doesn&#8217;t necessarily agree with the best engineering practices as we understand them <em>now</em>.</p>
<h5>Leaky&nbsp;modules</h5>
<p>Take the <em>module system</em>, for&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>Today, it is rather uncontroversial that the purpose of splitting code into multiple submodules
is to isolate it as much as possible and prevent accidental dependencies.
The benefit of such isolation is better internal cohesion for each module.
This can simplify testing, improve readability, foster simplicity,
and reduce cognitive burden on the&nbsp;maintainers.</p>
<p>Contemporary languages help achieving this goal
by making inter-module dependencies explicit.
If you want to use a symbol (functions, class) from module A inside another module B,
you typically have to&nbsp;both:</p>
<ul>
<li>declare it <em>public</em> in module&nbsp;A</li>
<li>explicitly <em>import</em> its name in module&nbsp;B</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step helps to ensure that the <span class="caps">API</span> of module A is limited and tractable.
The second step does the same to the external dependencies of module&nbsp;B.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Haskell requires neither of those steps.
In fact, it encourages precisely the <em>opposite</em> of well-defined, self-contained modules,
all by the virtue of its default&nbsp;behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li>the default module declaration (<code>module Foo where ...</code>)
implicitly declares <em>every symbol</em> defined in the module <code>Foo</code>
as public and importable by&nbsp;others</li>
<li>the default import statement (<code>import Foo</code>) brings in <em>every public symbol</em>
from the module <code>Foo</code> into the global namespace of the current&nbsp;module</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this is like putting <code>public</code> on each and every class or method
that you&#8217;d define in a Java project,
while simultaneously using nothing but wildcard (star) imports.
In a very short order, you will end up with project
where everything depends on everything else, and nothing can be developed in&nbsp;isolation.</p>
<h5>Namespaces are apparently a bad&nbsp;idea</h5>
<p>Thankfully, it is possible to avoid this pitfall
by explicitly declaring both your exported and imported&nbsp;symbols:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">-- Foo.hs --</span>
<span class="kr">module</span> <span class="nn">Foo</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nf">bar</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="kr">where</span>

<span class="nf">foo</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="nf">bar</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="nf">baz</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="o">...</span>  <span class="c1">-- not exported</span>

<span class="c1">-- Bar.hs --</span>
<span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nn">Foo</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">-- `bar` is inaccessible here, but `foo` is available</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But while this helps fighting the tangle of dependencies,
it still results in cluttering the namespace of any non-trivial module
with a significant number of imported&nbsp;symbols.</p>
<p>In many other languages, you can instead import the module as a whole
and only refer to its members using <em>qualified names</em>.
This is possible in Haskell as well, though it requires yet another variant
of the <code>import</code> statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="k">qualified</span> <span class="nn">Data.Text</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">Text</span>

<span class="nf">duplicateWords</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">Text</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">Text</span>
<span class="nf">duplicateWords</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">unwords</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">map</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">unwords</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">replicate</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="kt">Text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">words</span>
</pre></div>


<p>What if you want both, though? In the above code, for example,
the qualified name <code>Text.Text</code> looks a little silly,
especially when it&#8217;s such a common type.
It would be nice to import it directly, so that we can use it simply as <code>Text</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is only possible when using <em>two</em> <code>import</code> statements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nn">Data.Text</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Text</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="kr">import</span> <span class="k">qualified</span> <span class="nn">Data.Text</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">Text</span>

<span class="nf">duplicateWords</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Text</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Text</span>
<span class="nf">duplicateWords</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">Text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">unwords</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">map</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">unwords</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">replicate</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="kt">Text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">words</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You will find this duplication pervasive throughout Haskell codebases.
Given how it affects the most important third-party packages (like <code>text</code> and <code>bytestring</code>),
there have been a few proposals to improve the situation<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>,
but it seems that none can go through the syntax bikeshedding&nbsp;phase.</p>
<p>Contrast this with Rust, for example, where it&#8217;s common to see imports such as&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Read</span><span class="p">};</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">read_first_half</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nb">Path</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// (omitted)</span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>where <code>self</code> conveniently stands for the module as a&nbsp;whole.</p>
<h5>Wild&nbsp;records</h5>
<p>Another aspect of the difficulties with keeping your namespaces in check
relates to Haskell <em>record types</em> &#8212; its rough equivalent of <code>struct</code>s from C and&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>When you define a record&nbsp;type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kr">data</span> <span class="kt">User</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kt">User</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">usrFirstName</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
                 <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">usrLastName</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
                 <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">usrEmail</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">String</span>
                 <span class="p">}</span> <span class="kr">deriving</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Show</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>you are declaring not one but multiple different names,
and dumping them all straight into the global namespace.
These names&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the record <em>type</em> (here, <code>User</code>)</li>
<li>its <em>type constructor</em> (also <code>User</code>, second one&nbsp;above)</li>
<li>all of its fields (<code>usrFirstName</code>, <code>usrLastName</code>, <code>usrEmail</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yep, thats right.
Because Haskell has no special syntax for accessing record fields,
each field declaration creates an unqualified getter function.
Combined with the lack of function overloading,
this creates many opportunities for name&nbsp;collisions.</p>
<p>This is why in the above example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">Hungarian notation</a> is used to prevent those clashes.
Despite its age and almost complete disuse in basically every other language,
it is still a widely accepted practice in Haskell<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Purity beats&nbsp;practicality</h4>
<p>We have previously discussed the multiple ways of working with strings
and handling errors in Haskell. While somewhat confusing at times,
there at least appears to be an agreement in the community as to which one
should generally be&nbsp;preferred.</p>
<p>This is not the case for some subtler and more abstract&nbsp;topics.</p>
<p>Haskell is, famously,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming"><em>purely functional</em> programming language</a>.
Evaluating functions, in a mathematical sense,
is all a Haskell program is supposed to be doing.
But the obvious problem is
that such a program wouldn&#8217;t be able to do anything actually <em>useful</em>;
there needs to be some way for it to <em>effect</em> the environment it runs in,
if only to print the results it&nbsp;computed.</p>
<p>How to reconcile the functional purity with real-world applications
is probably the most important problem
that the Haskell language designers have to contend with.
After a couple of decades of research <em>and</em> industrial use
it still doesn&#8217;t have a satisfactory&nbsp;answer.</p>
<p>Yes, there is the <code>IO</code> monad, but it is a very blunt instrument.
It offers a distinction between pure code and &#8220;effectful&#8221; code,
but allows for no granularity or structure for the latter.
An <code>IO</code>-returning function can do literally anything,
while a pure function can only compute some value based on its arguments.
Most code, however, is best placed somewhere between those two&nbsp;extremes.</p>
<p>How to represent different varieties of <em>effects</em> (filesystem, logging, network, etc.)?<br>
How to express them as function constraints that can be verified by the compiler?<br>
How to compose them? How to extend them?<br></p>
<p>These (and others) are still very much open questions in the Haskell community.
The traditional way of dealing with them are <em>monad transformers</em>,
but they suffer from many shortcomings<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>.
More recent solutions like <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/extensible-effects">effects</a>
or <a href="http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html">free monads</a> are promising,
but exhibit performance issues that likely won&#8217;t be solvable without full compiler support.
And even so, you can <a href="https://markkarpov.com/post/free-monad-considered-harmful.html">convincingly argue against</a>
those new approaches,
which suggests that we may ultimately need something else&nbsp;entirely.</p>
<p>Of course, this state of affairs doesn&#8217;t really prevent anyone
from writing useful applications in Haskell.
&#8220;Regular&#8221; monads are still a fine choice.
Indeed, even if you end up stuffing most of your code inside plain <code>IO</code>,
it will already be a step up compared to most other&nbsp;languages.</p>
<h4>Good&nbsp;Enough™</h4>
<p>Incidentally, something similar could probably be said about the language as a&nbsp;whole.</p>
<p>Yes, it has numerous glaring flaws and some not-so-obvious shortcomings.<br>
Yes, it requires disciplined coding style and attention to readability.<br>
Yes, it will force you to courageously tackle problems
that are completely unknown to programmers using other languages.<br>
In the end, however, you will probably find it better than most&nbsp;alternatives.</p>
<p>Basically, Haskell is like pizza:
even when it&#8217;s bad, it is still <em>pretty good</em>.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s possibly the best thing about it
is that you don&#8217;t even really need to adopt Haskell in order to benefit from its innovations
(and avoid the legacy&nbsp;warts).</p>
<p>There is already a breed of mainstream languages
that can aptly be characterized as &#8220;Haskell-lite&#8221;:
heavily influenced by <span class="caps">FP</span> paradigms but without subscribing to them completely.
The closest example in this category is of course Scala,
while the newest one would be Rust.<br>
In many aspects, they offer a great compromise
that provides some important functional features
while sparing you most of the teething issues
that Haskell still has after almost 30 years.
Functional purists may not be completely satisfied,
but at least they&#8217;ll get to keep their typeclasses and&nbsp;monoids.</p>
<p>And what if you don&#8217;t want to hear about this <span class="caps">FP</span> nonsense at all?&#8230;
Well, I&#8217;m afraid it will get harder and harder to avoid.
These days, it&#8217;s evidently fine for a language to omit generics
but it seems inconceivable to ditch <a href="https://gobyexample.com/closures">first-class functions</a>.
Even the traditional <span class="caps">OOP</span> powerhouse like Java
cannot do without
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html">support for anonymous (&#8220;lambda&#8221;) functions</a>
anymore.
And let&#8217;s not forget
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#Chaining">all</a>
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html#flatMap-java.util.function.Function-">the</a>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.enumerable.selectmany.aspx">numerous</a>
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#flatMap-java.util.function.Function-">examples</a>
of monadic constructs
that pervade many of the mature APIs, libraries, and&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>So even if you, understandably, don&#8217;t really want to come to Haskell,
it&#8217;s looking more and more likely that Haskell will soon come to you&nbsp;:)</p>

  <div>
      <p>Just like many other people, I was following news from the last week&#8217;s
<a href="https://build.microsoft.com/"><span class="caps">BUILD</span> conference</a> with piqued interest. The ability to run Linux userland programs
on Windows &#8212; including, of course,
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/be-very-afraid-hell-has-frozen-over-bash-is-coming-to-windows-10/">bash</a> &#8212;
is something to be excited about. If nothing else, it should dramatically improve Windows support of new programming
languages that seem to pop up all the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>There was something else, however, that I couldn&#8217;t help but notice. The reactions of tech communities to this and similar developments focused very frequently on Microsoft&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>The beloved &#8220;new Microsoft&#8221;,
as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4cqm9y/xamarin_becomes_free_and_opensource/d1kjwl8">some call it</a>,
embraces open source, supports Linux, and generally does almost a full 180 with their stance on
proprietary vs. free software. The circumstances fit this narrative rather snuggly, too: a new <span class="caps">CEO</span> makes a clean break
with the past to pivot the company in this new world ruled by mobile and&nbsp;cloud.</p>
<p>Still&#8230; <em>love</em>? Even considering how Internet comments are grotesquely exaggerated most of the time, that&#8217;s quite
a declaration. The sentiment is nowhere near isolated either. But it&#8217;s not a question whether this infatuation
has a rational merit, or whether those feelings will eventually turn out to be&nbsp;misplaced.</p>
<p>The question is: why does it exist at all? We are talking about a <em>company</em> here, a for-profit organization.
How can such a language even enter the&nbsp;picture?</p>
<p>Then I realized this is not really a new phenomenon. Quite the opposite: the broad developer community seems to
always need a company to champion its core values. Nowadays, we&#8217;re simply trying to find someone new
to carry the&nbsp;standard.</p>
<p>Why? Because we feel that our old heroes have forsaken&nbsp;us.</p>
<h4>Hall of past&nbsp;fame</h4>
<p>Take <strong>GitHub</strong> for example. Once a darling of the open source community, it&#8217;s been suffering sharp criticism
for many months now. Rightfully or not, many people aren&#8217;t exactly excited &#8212; to put it mildly &#8212; about changes to
the <a href="https://github.com/blog/2146-organizations-can-now-block-abusive-users">policy</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/blog/2039-adopting-the-open-code-of-conduct">atmosphere</a> at GitHub,
typified by the ill-fated <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/githubs-ceo-ditches-meritocracy-rug-2014-1">meritocracy rug</a>.
The widely backed and long standing <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github">plea for a few critical features</a>
has only recently stopped falling on deaf ears. And in the background, there are always concerns about GitHub simply
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10823128">becoming too big</a>, and exterting too much control over
the open source&nbsp;ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Nota bene</em>, the very same ecosystem it had once been lauded for&nbsp;nurturing.</p>
<p>Among the other flagship tech companies, <strong>Apple</strong> or <strong>Facebook</strong> have never garnered much good will. Sure, they are
recognized for the pure utilitarian value of hardware they produce; or convenience, broad applicability, and stability
of APIs they offer. Facebook may be scoring some additional points for trying to
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">sort out</a> the mess of frontend development, but many say it&#8217;s
<a href="https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.j740brod8">not doing anybody any favors</a>.
Neither company is easy to portray as a paragon of openness, though, and it&#8217;s probably easier to argue
<a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/apples-closed-ecosystem-threatening-derail-technological-revolution-1535944">the exact opposite</a>.</p>
<p>And then there is <strong>Google</strong>, of course<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Some time in the past few years, a palpable shift occurred in how
the company is perceived by the techie crowd. It&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint the exact pivotal moment, and the
<a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">one event that leaps to attention</a>
doesn&#8217;t seem sufficient to explain it. But the tone has been set,
allowing <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html">news</a> to be
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2yt73v/google_to_close_google_code_open_source_project/cpdb6xs">molded</a>
to fit it. Add this to the usual backdrop of complaints about the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ll864/my_horrible_google_interview_experience/">onerous</a>
interview process and general fearmongering, and the picture doesn&#8217;t look very&nbsp;bright.</p>
<h4>Shades of&nbsp;grey</h4>
<p>No similar woes seem to have been plaguing Microsoft as of late, even though their record of recent &#8220;unwholesome&#8221; deeds
isn&#8217;t exactly
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2447177/updategate-windows-10-is-resetting-default-apps-back-to-microsoft-stock">clean</a>
either. Does it mean they are indeed the most fitting candidate for a (new) enterprise ally of the hacker&nbsp;community?&#8230;</p>
<p>Or maybe we can finally recognize the whole notion as the utterly silly concept it actually is. Hard to shake though
it be, this quasi-Manicheic mentality of assigning labels of virtue or sin is, at best, a naive idealism. At worst,
it&#8217;s a peculiar kind of harmful partisanship that technologists are particularly susceptible to. You may recognize it
as something that has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">very long tradition</a> in the hacker&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a tradition worth&nbsp;keeping.</p>
