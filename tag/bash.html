      <p>Contrary to an infamous opinion from a bygone era,
<span class="caps">640KB</span> is not really sufficient for anyone anymore.
A typical website exceeds that easily,
and executable programs are usually measured in&nbsp;megabytes.</p>
<p>But what if you only had 1234 <em>bytes</em> to work&nbsp;with?&#8230;</p>
<p>A friend of mine, <a href="http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?blog=1&amp;lang=en">Gynvael Coldwind</a>,
organized a game programming compo<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that had precisely this limitation.
Unlike most demoscene ones, however, the size limit here
applies to either the final binary <em>or</em> its source code.
This can be chosen at the participant&#8217;s&nbsp;discretion.</p>
<p>Since my currently favorite compiled language produces
<a href="https://lifthrasiir.github.io/rustlog/why-is-a-rust-executable-large.html">the exact opposite of small binaries</a>,
I was quite intrigued by the source code option.
But as the rules say, the final game must run
on a <em>clean</em> installation (only standard packages) of either Windows or Ubuntu Linux.
The choice of viable languages and technologies was therefore rather&nbsp;limited.</p>
<p>It was time to get <em>a little</em>&nbsp;creative.</p>
<h4>Game&nbsp;theory</h4>
<p>What must an environment provide to be a suitable platform for game development?
Not much, really. We only need to be able&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>put stuff on the&nbsp;screen</li>
<li>react to user&nbsp;input</li>
<li>execute time-dependent&nbsp;logic</li>
</ul>
<p>You could arguably get away without the last one,
but the kind of games you would end up with
had gone out of fashion about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">half a century ago</a>.
For the &#8220;real&#8221; arcade games, we really ought to run our code at least a dozen times per&nbsp;second.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only a handful of standard technologies that allow all of this out of the&nbsp;box.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a wee bit out of touch with Windows these days
but on Linux, there&#8217;s one thing that I really wanted to take for a serious spin.
And luckily for me, it also has one extremely terse language to go hand in hand&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking, of course, about the <strong><span class="caps">ANSI</span> terminal</strong> that can be scripted in Bash.
If there ever was anything that worked anywhere by default,
then this got to be it<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>&#8230;put into&nbsp;practice</h4>
<p>Note that I&#8217;ve stressed the &#8220;terminal&#8221; part.
The shell itself is a neat instrument,
but (perhaps surprisingly) it doesn&#8217;t actually concern itself
with displaying anything on the&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>This has traditionally been the job of a <em>terminal emulator</em>.
To this end, it has a couple of <a href="http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes">special codes</a>
that are undoubtedly useful for an aspiring indie shell game developer.
They are what allows us to display things in a specific position on the screen,
complete with chosen color, background color, and (text)&nbsp;style.</p>
<p>So this nails down our first requisite&nbsp;feature.</p>
<p>As for the second one, the vanilla <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_08_02.html"><code>read</code> command</a>
supports everything we may need for handling user input.
The only real &#8220;trick&#8221; is passing the <code>-n</code> flag
which makes it wait for a specific number of characters (e.g. one)
rather than a whole line ending with <em>Enter</em>.
Add a few more flags &#8212; like the one that prevents text from being echoed back to the console &#8212;
and you can make a rudimentary input&nbsp;loop:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">KEY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;\0&#39;</span>
<span class="k">while</span> :<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nb">read</span> -rsn <span class="m">1</span> KEY
<span class="k">done</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I can imagine, however, that you&#8217;d want to do other things besides just waiting for input.
Stuff like &#8220;updating the game state&#8221; and &#8220;drawing the next frame&#8221;
is generally considered pretty important in&nbsp;games.</p>
<p>Normally, we would deal with those things in between checking for input events,
leading to a particular structure of the so-called <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">real-time loop</a>.</p>
<p>But the shell doesn&#8217;t really handle input via &#8220;events&#8221;.
Instead, you just ask for some text and wait until you get it.
There is no &#8220;peek mode&#8221; that&#8217;d allow to squeeze in some rendering logic before the next key&nbsp;press.</p>
<p>What do we do, then, with a tight loop that leaves us no wiggle&nbsp;room?&#8230;</p>
<p>Why, we take a crowbar and pry it&nbsp;open!</p>
<h5>(Don&#8217;t) be&nbsp;alarmed</h5>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by noticing that to run some code whenever there is nothing else to do
has a rough equivalent of running it <em>periodically</em>.
This isn&#8217;t an exactly new observation:
the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout"><code>setTimeout</code> function</a> in JavaScript
has been the basis of &#8220;real-time&#8221; animation
since the 90s era of falling snowflakes, and up to the contemporary browser games<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Neither does the shell nor the hosting terminal support anything like <code>setTimeout</code>, though.
But fortunately, they don&#8217;t need to: Linux itself does.
And it accomplishes it quite effortlessly, due to the sole fact of <em>being an operating system</em>.
All we have to do is access some of its capabilities directly from the shell&nbsp;script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">KEY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;\0&#39;</span>
<span class="nv">DT</span><span class="o">=</span>0.05  <span class="c"># timeout value in seconds</span>

tick<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c"># .. do stuff ...</span>
    <span class="o">(</span> sleep <span class="nv">$DT</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">kill </span>ALRM <span class="nv">$$</span> <span class="o">)</span><span class="p">&amp;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>

<span class="nb">trap </span>tick ALRM
tick
<span class="k">while</span> :<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nb">read</span> -rsn <span class="m">1</span> KEY
<span class="k">done</span>
</pre></div>


<p>What we&#8217;re doing here is set up the <code>tick</code> function to be
a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal">signal</a> handler</em>.
A callback, if you&nbsp;will.</p>
<p>Inside of this callback, we can do all the state updates and drawing we need,
as long as we follow it with &#8220;scheduling&#8221; of the next <code>tick</code> call.
As a direct equivalent of a <code>setTimeout</code> invocation, this can be done&nbsp;by:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting a subshell to run in the background (with <code>&amp;</code>)</li>
<li>letting it sleep for however long we want to delay the next&nbsp;update</li>
<li>sending a signal to the main script (<code>kill $$</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The signal we chose is of course <code>SIGALRM</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
Technically, however, it can be anything,
as long as we can set up a <code>trap</code> to actually handle&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>In any case, success! Bash is officially a game programming&nbsp;platform!</p>
<h4>Integration in&nbsp;parts</h4>
<p>And so having figured out the technicalities,
I was faced with the crucial dilemma: <em>what</em> game could I actually&nbsp;write?</p>
<p>Nothing too complicated, that&#8217;s for sure.
After the initial scaffolding has used up about 1/4 of the harsh size limit,
I knew that radical simplicity was the order of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>And so I went for possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">the most trivial game ever</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/Flappy_Bird_gameplay.png" alt="flap flap"></br>
    <small>Sorry, Pong!</small>
</p>

<p>Then, after hours of (<em>ahem</em>) <a href="https://www.flappybird.com/">meticulous research</a>,
I managed to reverse-engineer the core&nbsp;mechanic:</p>
<ul>
<li>let the bird fall down with a constant&nbsp;acceleration</li>
<li>to jump, give it some upwards-facing&nbsp;velocity</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually <a href="https://github.com/Xion/flappybash/blob/0372ef9173c921ff79c64553974cea0b02c2bb3f/flappybash.sh">coding this</a>
in Bash was mostly a matter of finding out how to perform floating-point calculations.
Rather unsurprisingly, this is done through
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bc_(programming_language)#Using_bc_in_shell_scripts">an external program</a>,
while truncating of the fractional part involves &#8212; wait for it &#8212;
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/167059"><em>string formatting</em></a>.</p>
<h4>Pipe&nbsp;dream</h4>
<p>Based on the above nuggets of Stack Overflow wisdom,
you&#8217;ve probably figured out that Bash isn&#8217;t exactly what you would call <em>a programming language</em>.
With a little bit of perseverance, however, we can make it do our bidding&#8230;
<em>some</em> fraction of the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>So far, I had the player character &#8212; a beautiful red rectangle &#8212;
fall down under the constant force of gravity, and maybe ascend if the Space key has been pressed.
But a heroic protagonist necessitates the presence of formidable adversaries,
so my next step was to figure out how to implement this crucial gameplay&nbsp;mechanic.</p>
<p>Which one?&#8230; Pipes, of&nbsp;course.</p>
<p>Pipes in <em>Bash</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/irony-sign.jpg" alt="...ahem">
</p>

<p>It was pretty evident I&#8217;m gonna need to represent them somehow,
and Bash isn&#8217;t exactly known for its strong repertoire of data structures.
Starting from version 4.0, it does however have <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/arrays.html">arrays</a>,
so there is at least something we can work&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not get <em>too</em> carried away, though.
The somewhat obvious idea of mirroring the entire game field in a (pseudo) 2D array
of pipe/not-pipe turned out to be completely unworkable.
The fill rate of most (all?) terminal emulators is nowhere near sufficient
to permit redrawing of the whole screen <em>and</em> maintaining <span class="caps">FPS</span> value above the slideshow&nbsp;threshold.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Xion/flappybash/commit/467fe6429fa8dcc7005f5324278804243204ec9a">What I went with instead</a>
was a 1D array for the pipe itself, and a separate variable to denote its horizontal position.
Working from there, it wasn&#8217;t too hard to
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/flappybash/commit/5e3281e408767eab2ade2fa2f9299fee60681bdc">make it move</a>,
and eventually to check for its collision with the player&nbsp;object.</p>
<h4>Fitting&nbsp;in</h4>
<p>That, of course,
was <a href="https://github.com/Xion/flappybash/commit/ff3260e1dd5fa61695310578091ff922acf06e71">the most important milestone</a>.
<br/>
I added <em>an objective</em>.</br>
It was <em>an actual game</em>.</p>
<p>And I still had about 100 bytes&nbsp;left!</p>
<p>Speaking of size, this is probably a good moment
to talk about making the most of those meager 1234 bytes.
It&#8217;s not exactly surprising that it was possible mostly thanks to <em>minification</em>.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s extremely popular for JavaScript,
the same abundance of minification utilities cannot be expected when it comes of shell scripts.
Still, &#8220;bash minification&#8221; does return some useful search results,
and <a href="http://bash-minifier.appspot.com/">one of them</a> is what I used to shrink the final&nbsp;script.</p>
<p>Obviously, it didn&#8217;t go without some trouble.
Since the minifier does little more than to swap newlines for semicolons,
it got a few bugs that had to be ironed out.
No big deal, really:
a small batch of
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/flappybash/commit/a9556bbef8245bd1ce849e1bffd175412934ef9d">handcrafted, artisanal Python</a>
was enough to paper over the&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>The other technique you can use to slim down is <em>obfuscation</em>, i.e.
<a href="https://github.com/Xion/flappybash/commit/f2683785a8049fc385e5c6705f66dbb835ad84bc">shortening of the identifiers</a>.
As the minifier didn&#8217;t offer this feature natively, I had to take care of it&nbsp;myself.</p>
<p>This lead to adding such interesting assignments as this <code>p</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">p</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">printf</span>
</pre></div>


<p>which absolutely shouldn&#8217;t be confused with <em>this</em> <code>p</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># put text at given position: p $x $y $text</span>
p<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> -en <span class="s2">&quot;\e[</span><span class="nv">$2</span><span class="s2">;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">1</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">f</span><span class="nv">$3</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason it works is that in <span class="caps">POSIX</span> shells,
variables and functions effectively form two separate namespaces.
Their members are thus referred to in two different&nbsp;ways:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>p <span class="nv">$X</span> <span class="nv">$Y</span> <span class="s2">&quot;\e[1;37;41mB&quot;</span>  <span class="c"># call the p() function</span>
<span class="nv">$p</span> <span class="s2">&quot;\e[?25l&quot;</span>  <span class="c"># expand the p variable (i.e. call `printf`)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice how functions have longer definitions but shorter usage,
while the opposite is true for variables.
Who can now say that Bash doesn&#8217;t find balance in all&nbsp;things?</p>
<h4>Auditory&nbsp;sensations</h4>
<p>Like I mentioned before, thanks to those and similar tricks
I had managed to carve out about a hundred or so bytes of free&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>Now, what could you possibly do with such a staggering&nbsp;amount?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/lawrence-office-space.jpg" alt="Two tweets at the same time!"></br>
    <small>&#8230;no, that won&#8217;t even be <em>one</em> tweet.</small>
</p>

<p>Well, let&#8217;s add some <em>sound effects</em>, shall&nbsp;we?</p>
<p>Before you think that&#8217;s preposterous, remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character">terminal bell</a>.
Sounding the bell is as simple as printing the <code>"\a"</code> character (<span class="caps">ASCII</span> 7),
which for this reason is also known as <code>BEL</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">echo</span> -e <span class="s2">&quot;\a&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Unfortunately, most terminal emulators silence the actual sound,
and replace it with a visual indicator &#8212; typically a bell <em>icon</em>.
If we want to make speakers reliably emit audible phenomena,
we sadly have to look&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
<p>Fortunately, modern Linux systems handle the sound card somewhat better
than you may have remembered from a few years ago.
This is usually thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture"><span class="caps">ALSA</span></a>,
a dedicated subsystem in the Linux kernel, and its numerous userspace&nbsp;complements.</p>
<p>One of them is the inconspicuous <code>speaker-test</code> binary
which, well, does exactly what it says on the&nbsp;can:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>speaker-test  <span class="c"># play some noise through the speakers</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can make it play a <span class="caps">WAV</span> file, too,
but the most interesting option is to synthesize a <em>sine wave</em>.
By adjusting its frequency, it&#8217;s easy to play higher and lower tones,
forming the building blocks for more complex&nbsp;sounds.</p>
<p>What you cannot control is the tone&#8217;s duration.
That&#8217;s not a big problem, though, since we can run <code>speaker-test</code> in a separate process
and then just <em><code>kill</code> it dead</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># play a sine wave (requires ALSA): s $frequency $duration</span>
s<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">(</span> speaker-test &gt;<span class="nv">$n</span> -t sine -f <span class="nv">$1</span> <span class="o">)</span><span class="p">&amp;</span> <span class="nv">_p</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$!</span><span class="p">;</span> sleep <span class="nv">$2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">kill</span> -9 <span class="nv">$_p</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a href="https://github.com/Xion/flappybash/commit/3f259418f3d6167492b7d849c659dfcee0c6aa3d">I&#8217;ve used this approach</a>
to play a simple, two-tone sound
whenever the player successfully overcomes a pipe obstacle.
And I would&#8217;ve probably taken it further if &#8220;<code>speaker_test</code>&#8221; wasn&#8217;t such a damn <em>long</em> string.
Unfortunately, it was one identifier I couldn&#8217;t afford to shorten,
and this had put a stop to my ambitious plan of improvising <a href="https://www.sadtrombone.com/">a sad trombone</a>
upon player&#8217;s failure&nbsp;:(</p>
<h4>;&nbsp;done</h4>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be right to say I wasn&#8217;t very happy with <a href="https://github.com/Xion/flappybash">the results</a>, though.
All in all, it was <a href="https://github.com/Xion/flappybash/commits/master">the most fun</a>
I had with coding in quite some time,
and definitely the most amusing Bash script I&#8217;ve ever&nbsp;written.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="http://xion.io/images/flappybash.jpg" alt="FLAPPY BASH">
</p>

<p>It also got me curious what other games people have implemented purely as shell scripts.
To my disappointment, there hadn&#8217;t been all that many.
Of those I could find, this <a href="http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/linux/EN/housenka-bash-game/">Snake clone</a>
in about <span class="caps">7KB</span> of (unobfuscated) Bash
is probably the most polished&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>As you can see then, this is clearly an under-appreciated platform
that evidently displays a lot of potential!
If you want to create games that are both very portable
and <em>extremely</em> space-efficient,
Bash is definitely a technology you should have a closer look at&nbsp;;-)</p>

is closer to the actual continuous processing in the background.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Regular programs could simply call <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/alarm.2.html">the <code>alarm</code> function</a>

      <p>Here&#8217;s a trick that&#8217;s hardly new, but if you haven&#8217;t heard about, it will save you a trip to a man page or&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;re a person who mostly prefers the terminal over some fancy <span class="caps">GUI</span>, you&#8217;ve probably used the <code>find</code> command
along with <code>xargs</code> at least a few times. It&#8217;s very common, for example, to use the results of <code>find</code> as arguments
to some other program. It could something as simple as figuring out which modules in your project have grown
slightly too&nbsp;large:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ find . -name &#39;*.py&#39; | xargs wc -l | sort -hr
1467 total
 322 callee/base.py
 261 callee/general.py
 251 callee/collections.py
# etc.
</pre></div>


<p>We find them all first, and then use <code>xargs</code> to build a long <code>wc</code> invocation, and we finally display results
in the reverse order. Pretty easy stuff: I don&#8217;t usually have to try more than a dozen times to get it right!<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But how about the opposite situation? Let&#8217;s say you have a list of <em>directories</em> you want to search through with <code>find</code>.
Doing so may seem easy enough<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs find -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>Except it&#8217;s not going to work. Like a few other Unix commands, <code>find</code> is very particular about the order of arguments
it receives. Not only are the predicate flags (like <code>-name</code>) considered in sequence, but they also have to appear
<em>after</em> the directories we want to search&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>But in the <code>xargs</code> invocation above, essentially the opposite is going to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<h4>The replacement&nbsp;flag</h4>
<p>So how to remedy this? Enter the <code>-I</code> flag to <code>xargs</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>This flag will tell <code>xargs</code> quite a few&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>The most important one is to stop putting the arguments at the end of the command invocation.
Instead, it shall place them wherever it sees the <em>replacement string</em> &#8212; here, pair of braces<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: <code>{}</code>.
And because we placed the braces where <code>find</code> is normally expecting the list of directories to search through,
the command will now get us exactly the results we&nbsp;wanted.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s almost impossible to see, however, is that it may not use the exact <em>way</em> we intended to obtain those results.
The difference is easier to spot when we replace <code>find</code> with <code>echo</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat &gt;/tmp/list
foo
bar
$ cat /tmp/list | xargs echo
foo bar
$ cat /tmp/list | xargs -I{} echo {}
foo
bar
</pre></div>


<p>or, better yet, use <code>xargs</code> with the <code>-t</code> flag to print the commands on stderr before executing&nbsp;them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat packagedirs.txt | xargs -I{} -t find {} -name &#39;__init__.py&#39; &gt;/dev/null
find callee -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
find tests -name &#39;__init__.py&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, we actually have more than one <code>find</code> invocation&nbsp;here!</p>
<p>This is the second effect of <code>-I</code>: it causes <code>xargs</code> to execute given command line <em>for each argument separately</em>.
It so happens that it doesn&#8217;t really make any difference for our usage of <code>find</code>, which is why it wasn&#8217;t at all obvious
we were running it multiple&nbsp;times.</p>
<p>To avoid problems, though, you should definitely be cognizant of this fact when calling other programs with <code>xargs -I</code>.</p>
<h4>Make arguments spaced&nbsp;again</h4>
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;m not aware of any method that&#8217;d actually make <code>xargs</code> produce <code>find foo bar -name ...</code> calls.
If you need this exact form, probably the easiest way is to use plain old shell&nbsp;variables:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find $d -name &#39;*.py&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>This takes advantage of the <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting">word splitting</a> feature of Bash and a few other
compatible shells. Caveat is, you may be using a shell where this behavior is disabled by default. The result would be
making <code>find</code> interpret the content of <code>$d</code> as a <em>single</em> directory name: <code>foo bar</code> rather than <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>.</p>
<p>zsh is one such shell. Although <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/zshfaq03.html#l18">probably a good thing overall</a>,
in times like these you&#8217;d want to bring the &#8220;normal&#8221; behavior back. In zsh, it&#8217;s fortunately pretty&nbsp;simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt); find ${=d} -name &#39;*.py&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>What about a portable solution? As far as I can tell, the only certain way you can ensure word splitting occurs
is to use <code>eval</code>. Here, the <code>xargs</code> command can actually come in handy again, albeit only as a&nbsp;prop:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ (d=$(cat packagedirs.txt | xargs echo); eval &quot;find $d -name &#39;*.py&#39;&quot;)
</pre></div>


<p>One would hope such hacks aren&#8217;t needed very&nbsp;often.</p>

<p>A completely kosher version would also use the <code>-print0</code> flag to <code>find</code> and the <code>-0</code> flag to <code>xargs</code>.
It&#8217;s not necessary here because Python module files cannot contain spaces.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Purists shall excuse my use of <code>cat</code> here, it&#8217;s merely for illustrative purposes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>This use of braces in <code>find</code> has of course nothing to do with the <em>other</em> possible occurrences of <code>{}</code> there,
like in the <code>-exec</code> flag. Since you cannot force <code>find</code> to expect a different placeholder, you should use something else
for <code>xargs</code> in those cases, .e.g: <code>xargs -I^ find ^ -name '__main__.py' -exec 'python {}' \;</code>.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
