    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>Here&#8217;s a neat little trick
that&#8217;s especially useful if you&#8217;re just starting out with&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<p>Because the language uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">type inference</a> all over the place
(or at least within a single function),
it can often be difficult to figure out the type of an expression by yourself.
Such knowledge is very handy in resolving compiler errors,
which may be rather complex when generics and traits are&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p>The formula itself is very simple.
Its shortest, most common version &#8212; and arguably the cleverest one, too &#8212;
is the following <code>let</code> binding:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">some_expression</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>In virtually all cases, this binding will cause a type error on its own,
so it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;d leave permanently in your regular&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>But the important part here is the exact error message you&nbsp;get:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:42:13
   |
42 |         let () = some_expression;
   |             ^^ expected f64, found ()
   |
   = note: expected type `f64`
   = note:    found type `()`
</pre></div>


<p>The type expected by Rust here (in this example, <code>f64</code>)
is also the type of <code>some_expression</code>. No more, no&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>There is nothing particularly wrong with using this technique
and not caring too much how it works under the hood.
But if you do want to know a little more what exactly is going on here,
the rest of this post covers it in some&nbsp;detail.</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;unit</h4>
<p>Firstly, you may be wondering about this curious <code>()</code> type
that the compiler has apparently found in the statement above.
The official name for it is the <em>unit type</em>,
and it has several notable&nbsp;characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>There exists only one value<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of this type: <code>()</code> (same symbol as the type&nbsp;itself).</li>
<li>It represents an empty tuple and has therefore the size of&nbsp;zero.</li>
<li>It is the type of any expression that&#8217;s turned into a <em>statement</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That last fact is particularly interesting,
as it makes <code>()</code> appear in error messages that are more indicative of syntactic mishaps
rather than mismatched&nbsp;types:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">positive_signum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="k">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="k">i32</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<!-- -->

<div class="highlight"><pre>error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:2:17
  |
2 |     if x &gt; 0 { 1i32 }
  |                ^^^^ expected (), found i32
  |
  = note: expected type `()`
  = note:    found type `i32`
</pre></div>


<p>If you think about it, however, it makes perfect sense.
The last expression inside a function body is the return value.
This also means that everything <em>before</em> it has to be a statement:
an expression of type <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>Working its way backward,
Rust will therefore expect only such expressions before the final <code>0i32</code>.
This, in turn, puts the same constraint on the body of the <code>if</code> statement.
The expression <code>1i32</code> (with its type of <code>i32</code>) clearly violates it,
causing the above error<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h4><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Expanded&#8221;&nbsp;version</h4>
<p>A natural question now arises:
is <code>()</code> inside of the <code>let () = ...</code> formula a <em>type</em> <code>()</code> or a <em>value</em> <code>()</code>?&#8230;</p>
<p>To answer that,
it&#8217;s quite helpful to compare and contrast the original binding with its longer&nbsp;&#8220;equivalent&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">_</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">some_expression</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>This statement is conceptually very similar to our original one.
The error message it causes can also be used to debug issues with type&nbsp;inference.</p>
<p>Despite some cryptic symbols, the syntax here should also be more familiar.
It occurs in many typical, ordinary bindings you can see in everyday Rust code.
Here&#8217;s an&nbsp;example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>where it&#8217;s abundantly clear that <code>i32</code> is the type of variable <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Analogously above, you can see that
an unnamed symbol (<code>_</code>, the underscore) is declared to be of type <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>So in this alternate phrasing, <code>()</code> denotes a <em>type</em>.</p>
<h4>Let a pattern&nbsp;emerge</h4>
<p>What about the original form, <code>let () = ...</code>?
There is no explicit type declaration here (i.e. no colon),
and a pair of empty parentheses isn&#8217;t a name that could be assigned a new&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>What exactly is happening there,&nbsp;then?&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, it isn&#8217;t really anything special.
While it may look exceptional, and totally unlike common usages of <code>let</code>,
it is in fact exactly the same thing as a mundane <code>let x = 5</code>.
The potential misconception here is about the exact meaning of <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>The simple version is that it&#8217;s a name for the bound expression.<br>
But the actual truth is that it&#8217;s a <em>pattern</em> which is matched against that&nbsp;expression.</p>
<p>The terms &#8220;pattern&#8221; and &#8220;matching&#8221; here refer to the same mechanism
that occurrs within <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/match.html">the <code>match</code> statement</a>.
You could even imagine a peculiar form of desugaring,
where a <code>let</code> statement is converted into a semantically equivalent <code>match</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">original</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">desugared</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">i32</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">match</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">match</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">            </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>This analogy works perfectly<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, because the patterns here are <em>irrefutable</em>:
any value can match them, as all we&#8217;re doing is giving the value a name.
Should the case be any different, Rust would reject our <code>let</code> statement &#8212;
just like it rejects a <code>match</code> block that doesn&#8217;t include branches for all possible&nbsp;outcomes.</p>
<h4>An empty&nbsp;pattern</h4>
<p>But just because a pattern has to always match the expression,
it doesn&#8217;t mean only simple identifiers like <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> are permitted in <code>let</code>.
If Rust is able to statically ensure a match,
it is perfectly <span class="caps">OK</span> to use a pattern with an internal structure<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Wrapping</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Wrapping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Wrapping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Of course, something like this is just superfluous and silly.
Same mechanism, however, is also behind the ability to &#8220;initialize multiple&nbsp;variables&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>What really happens is that we take a <em>tuple expression</em> <code>(0, 1)</code>
and match it against a pattern <code>(x, y)</code>.
Because it is trivially satisified,
we have the symbols <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> bound to the tuple elements.
For all intents and purposes, this is equivalent to having two separate <code>let</code> statements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Of course, a 2-tuple is not the only pattern of this kind we can use in <code>let</code>.
Others possible patterns include, for example, the <em>0-tuple</em>.</p>
<p>Or, as we express it in Rust, <code>()</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that&#8217;s a truly useless statement!
But it also harkens straight to our debug binding.
It should be pretty clear now how it&nbsp;works:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>()</code> stanza on the left is neither a type nor a name, but a <em>pattern</em>.</li>
<li>The expression on the right is being <em>matched</em> against this&nbsp;pattern.</li>
<li>Because the types of both of those things differ, the compiler signals an appropriate&nbsp;error.</li>
</ul>
<p>The curious thing is that there is nothing inherently magical about using <code>()</code> on the left hand side.
It&#8217;s simply the shortest pattern we can put after <code>let</code>.
It&#8217;s also one that&#8217;s extremely unlikely to actually match the right hand side,
which ensures we get the desired error.
But if you substituted something equally exotic and rare &#8212; say, <code>(x, ((y, z), Wrapping(w)))</code> &#8212;
it would work equally well as a rudimentary type&nbsp;detector.</p>
<p>Except for one thing, of course: nobody wants to type this much!
Borne out of this frugality (and/or laziness), a custom thus emerged to use <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>Short, sweet, and <em>clever</em>.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>A more formal, type-theoretic formulation of this fact
is saying that <code>()</code> is <em>inhabited</em> by only one value.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>In case you are wondering, one possible fix here is to <code>return 1i32;</code> inside the <code>if</code>.
An (arguably more idiomatic) alternative is to put <code>0i32</code> in an <code>else</code> branch,
turning the entire <code>if</code> construct into the last &#8212; and only &#8212; expression in the function body.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Note how each nested <code>match</code> is also introducing a new scope,
exactly like the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.10.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html#thinking-in-scopes">canonical desugaring</a>
of <code>let</code> which is often used to explain lifetimes and borrowing.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>Unfortunately, Rust isn&#8217;t currently capable of proving that the pattern is irrefutable in all obvious cases.
For example, <code>let Some(x) = Some(42);</code> will be rejected due to the existence of a <code>None</code> variant in <code>Option</code>,
even though it isn&#8217;t actually used in the (constant) expression on the right.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Having recently been writing some C++ code at work, I had once again experienced the kind of exasperation that this
cumbersome language evokes on regular basis. When I was working in it less sporadically, I was shrugging it off
and telling myself it&#8217;s all because of the low level it operates on. Superior performance was the other side of the deal,
and it was supposed to make all the trade-offs&nbsp;worthwhile.</p>
<p>Now, however, I realized that running close to the metal by no means excuses the sort of clunkiness that C++ permits.
For example, there really is no reason why the archaically asinine separation of header <span class="amp">&amp;</span> source files &#8212;
with its inevitable redundancy of declarations and definitions, worked around with Java-esque contraptions such as
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PimplIdiom">pimpl</a> &#8212; is still the bread and butter of C++ programs.<br/>
Same goes for the lack of sane dependency management, or a universal, portable build system. None of those would be
at odds with native compilation to machine code, or runtime speeds that are adequate for real-time&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>Rather than dwelling on those gripes, I thought it&#8217;d be more productive to look around and see what&#8217;s
the modern offerring in the domain of lower level, <em>really</em> fast languages. The search wasn&#8217;t long at all, because
right now it seems there is just one viable contender: Rust<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Rusty&nbsp;systems</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> introduces itself as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language">&#8220;systems programming language&#8221;</a>, which is quite a bold claim.
What followed the last time this phrase has been applied to an emerging language &#8212; Go &#8212; was a kind of
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Of-the-emerging-systems-languages-Rust-D-Go-and-Nim-which-is-the-strongest-language-and-why">word twisting</a>
that&#8217;s more indicative of politics, not computer&nbsp;science.</p>
<p>But Rust&#8217;s pretense to the system level is well justified. It clearly provides the requisite toolkit for working
directly with the hardware, be it <a href="https://github.com/miselin/rustic">embedded controllers</a> or
<a href="http://www.redox-os.org/">fully featured computers</a>. It offers compilation to native machine code;
direct memory access; running time guarantees thanks to the lack of <span class="caps">GC</span>-incuded stops;
and great interoperability through static and dynamic&nbsp;linkage.</p>
<p>In short, with Rust you can wreak havoc against the <span class="caps">RAM</span> and twiddle bits to your heart&#8217;s&nbsp;content.</p>
<h4>Safe and&nbsp;sound</h4>
<p>To be fair, though, the &#8220;havoc&#8221; part is not entirely accurate. Despite its focus on the low level, efficient computing,
Rust aims to be a very safe language. Unlike C, it actively tries to prevent the programmer from shooting themselves
in the foot &#8212; though it will hand you the gun if you but ask for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The safety guarantees provided by Rust apply to resource management, with the specific emphasis on memory
and pointers to it. The way that most contemporary languages deal with memory is by introducing a <em>garbage collector</em>
which mostly (though not wholly) relieves the programmer from thinking about allocations and deallocations.
However, the kind of global, stop-the-world garbage collections
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Na.C3.AFve_mark-and-sweep">mark-and-sweep</a>)
is costly and unpredictable, ruling it out as a mechanism for real-time&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>For this reason, Rust doesn&#8217;t mandate a <span class="caps">GC</span> of this kind<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. And although it offers mechanisms that are similar to
smart pointers from C++ (e.g. <code>std::shared_ptr</code>), it is actually preferable and <em>safer</em> to use regular, &#8220;naked&#8221; pointers:
<code>&amp;Foo</code> versus <code>Cell&lt;Foo&gt;</code> or <code>RefCell&lt;Foo&gt;</code> (which are some of the Rust&#8217;s &#8220;smart pointer&#8221;&nbsp;types).</p>
<p>The trick is in the clever compiler. As long as we use regular pointers, it is capable of detecting potential memory
bugs at <em>compilation time</em>. They are referred to as &#8220;data races&#8221; in Rust&#8217;s terminology, and include
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/references-and-borrowing.html#issues-borrowing-prevents">perennial problems</a>
that will segfault any C code which wasn&#8217;t written with utmost&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>Part of those safety guarantees is also the <em>default immutability</em> of references (pointers). The simplest reference
of type <code>&amp;Foo</code> in Rust translates to something like <code>const Foo * const</code> in C<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. You have to explicitly request
mutability with the <code>mut</code> keyword, and Rust ensures there is always at most one mutable reference to any value,
thus preventing problems caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_aliasing">pointer aliasing</a>.</p>
<p>But what if you really must sling raw pointers, and access arbitrary memory locations? Maybe you are programming
a microcontroller where I/O is done through a special memory region. For those occasions, Rust has got you covered
with the <code>unsafe</code> keyword:</p>

<p>Its usage, like in the above example, can be <em>very</em> localized, limited only to those places where it&#8217;s truly necessary
and guarded by the appropriate checks. As a result, the interface exposed by the above function
can be considered safe. The unrestricted memory access can be contained to where it&#8217;s really&nbsp;inevitable.</p>
<h4>Typing&nbsp;counts</h4>
<p>Ensuring memory safety is not the only way in which Rust differentiates itself from C.
What separates those two languages is also a few decades of practice and research into programming semantics.
It&#8217;s only natural to expect Rust to take advantage of this&nbsp;progress.</p>
<p>And advantage it takes. Although Rust&#8217;s type system isn&#8217;t nearly as advanced and complex like &#8212; say &#8212; Scala&#8217;s,
it exhibits several interesting properties that are indicative of its relatively modern&nbsp;origin.</p>
<p>First, it mixes the two most popular programming paradigms &#8212; functional and object-oriented &#8212; in roughly equal
concentrations, as opposed to being biased towards the latter. Rust doesn&#8217;t have interfaces or classes: it has <em>traits</em>
and their <em>implementations</em>. Even though they often fulfill similar purposes of abstraction and encapsulation,
these constructs are closer to the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class">type classes</a>
and their instances, which are found for example in&nbsp;Haskell.</p>
<p>Still, the more familiar notions of <span class="caps">OOP</span> aren&#8217;t too far off. Most of the key functionality of classes, for example,
can be simulated by implementing &#8220;default&#8221; traits for user-defined&nbsp;types:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Person</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>The second aspect of Rust&#8217;s type system that we would come to expect from a new language is its expressive power.
<em>Type inference</em> is nowadays a staple, and above we can observe the simplest form of it. But it extends further,
to generic parameters, closure arguments, and closure return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>Generics, by the way, are quite nice as well. Besides their applicability to structs, type aliases, functions,
traits, trait implementations, etc., they allow for constraining their arguments with traits. This is similar to
the abandoned-and-not-quite-revived-yet idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_%28C%2B%2B%29">concepts in C++</a>,
or to an analogous mechanism from&nbsp;C#.</p>
<p>The third common trend in contemporary language design is the use of type system to solve common tasks.
Rust doesn&#8217;t go full Haskell and opt for monads for everything, but its <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> types are evidently
the functional approach to error handling<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. To facilitate their use, a powerful
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/patterns.html"><em>pattern matching</em> facility</a> is also present in&nbsp;Rust.</p>
<h4>Unexpectedly&nbsp;pythonic</h4>
<p>If your general go-to language is Python, you will find Rust a very nice complement and possibly a valuable instrument
in your coding arsenal. Interoperability between Python and Rust is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/rust-inside-other-languages.html#python">stupidly easy</a>,
thanks to both the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/ctypes.html"><code>ctypes</code> module</a> and the extreme simplicity
of creating portable,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/rust-inside-other-languages.html#a-rust-library">shared libraries</a> in Rust.
Offloading some expensive, <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock"><span class="caps">GIL</span></a>-bypassing computation to a fast,
native code written in Rust can thus be a relatively painless way of speeding up crucial parts of a Python&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>But somewhat more surprisingly, Rust has quite a few bits that seem to be directly inspired by Python semantics.
Granted, those two languages are conceptually pretty far apart in general, but the analogies are&nbsp;there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/iterators.html">iterators</a> in Rust is very similar to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-iterable">iterables</a> in Python. Even the <code>for</code> loop is basically identical:
rather than manually increment a counter, both in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/loops.html#for">Rust</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop">Python</a> you iterate over a <em>range of numbers</em>.<br/>
Oh, and both languages have an <code>enumerate</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/loops.html#enumerate">method</a>/
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate">function</a> that yields pairs of <code>(index, element)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/method-syntax.html#method-calls">method definition</a>
in Rust uses the <code>self</code> keyword as first argument to distinguish between instance methods and &#8220;class&#8221;/&#8221;static&#8221; methods
(or <em>associated functions</em> in Rust&#8217;s parlance).
This is even more pythonic than in actual Python, where <code>self</code> is technically just a convention,
albeit an extremely strong&nbsp;one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In either language, overloading operators doesn&#8217;t use any new keywords or special syntax,
like it does in C++, C#, and others. Python accomplishes it through <code>__magic__</code> methods, whereas Rust
has very similarly named <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/operators-and-overloading.html">operator traits</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust basically <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/documentation.html#documentation-as-tests">has <code>doctest</code></a>.
If you don&#8217;t know, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html"><code>doctest</code> module</a> is a standard Python testing
utility that can run usage examples found in documentation comments and verify their correctness. Rust version (<code>rustdoc</code>)
is even more powerful and flexible, allowing for example to mark additional boilerplate lines that should be run
when testing examples, but <em>not</em> included in the generated&nbsp;documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the list doesn&#8217;t end here and will grow over time. As of this writing, for example, nightly builds of Rust
already offer <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/slice-patterns.html">advanced slice pattern matching</a> which are
very similar to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/">extended iterable unpacking</a> from Python&nbsp;3.</p>
<h4>Is it worth&nbsp;it?</h4>
<p>Depending on your background and the programming domain you are working in, you may be wondering if Rust
is a language that&#8217;s worth looking into now, or in the near&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Firstly, let me emphasize that it&#8217;s still in its early stages. Although the stable version 1.0 has been released
<a href="http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html">a good couple of months ago</a>, the ecosystem isn&#8217;t nearly as diverse
and abundant as in some of the other new&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>If you are specifically looking to deploying Rust-written <span class="caps">API</span> servers, backends, and other &#8212; shall I use the word
&#8212; microservices, then right now you&#8217;ll probably be better served by more established solutions,
like Java with <a href="http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/">fibers</a>, asynchronous Python on PyPy, Erlang,
Go, node.js, or similar.
I predict Rust catching up here in the coming months, though, because the prospect of writing native speed <span class="caps">JSON</span> slingers
with relative ease is just too compelling to&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>The other interesting area for Rust is <em>game programming</em>, because it&#8217;s one of the few languages capable of supporting
even the most demanding <span class="caps">AAA</span>+ productions. The good news is that portable, open source
<a href="http://www.piston.rs/">game engines</a> are already here. The bad news is that most of the existing knowledge
about designing and coding high performance games is geared towards writing (stripped down) C++. The community
is also rather <del>stubborn</del> reluctant to adopt anything that may carry even a <em>hint</em> of potentially unknown
performance implications. Although some inroads have been made (here&#8217;s, for example,
an <a href="https://github.com/HeroesGrave/ecs-rs">entity component system</a> written in Rust), and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
to see indie games written in Rust, it probably won&#8217;t take over the industry anytime&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware, though, Rust may already have the upper hand. It is obviously much easier language to program in
than pure C. Along with its toolchain&#8217;s ability to produce
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/no-stdlib.html">minimal executables</a>, it makes for a compelling language for
programming microcontrollers and other embedded&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>So in short, Rust is pretty nice. And if you have read that far, I think you should just go ahead
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">have a look</a> for yourself&nbsp;:)</p>
